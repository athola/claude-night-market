# Memory Palace Curation Log

Track every intake decision so the autonomy controller can earn trust and audits
can trace why an entry was accepted, merged, or pruned.

## Usage

1. **Capture** — append a row every time `intakeFlagPayload` is generated by the
   hooks or when `knowledge-intake` runs manually.
2. **Autonomy Evidence** — note the autonomy level that made the decision; demote
   or promote via `python -m memory_palace.cli autonomy <command>` if regret rate
   rises above 5%.
3. **Follow-ups** — include links to `docs/templates/intake_candidate.json` blobs,
   GitHub issues, or KonMari tasks so tending sessions can close the loop.
4. **Prompt Artifacts** — whenever `intake_cli.py` runs with `--dual-output`, append `prompt:<slug>` (for example `prompt:marginal-value-dual`) so the generated instructions in `docs/prompts/` stay tied to the audit trail.

Store this file in version control so we have a durable audit trail.
