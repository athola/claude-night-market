# Task 1 Findings – Tracker vs Docs
- plugins/minister/README.md mentions "GitHub comment digests" but lacks the actual `uv run ... --github-comment` command or `gh issue comment` workflow.
- skills/github-initiative-pulse docs describe generating GitHub comments but omit the paste workflow (`gh issue comment` / `gh pr comment`).
- No doc explicitly ties tracker output to Projects or issue permalink storage.

## Writing-Clearly-And-Concisely Guardrails
- Favor active voice and direct sentences (10–20 words) per writing standards summary.
- Strip filler words; lead each paragraph with actionable guidance tied to GitHub workflows.
- Keep documentation audiences obvious (Program leads, Release managers) and highlight command-first instructions.
