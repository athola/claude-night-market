# TodoWrite Patterns

## Naming Convention

Pattern: `skill-name:step-name`

## Evidence Logging Steps

```
evidence-logging:log-initialized
evidence-logging:commands-captured
evidence-logging:citations-recorded
evidence-logging:artifacts-indexed
```

## Diff Analysis Steps

```
diff-analysis:context-established
diff-analysis:changes-categorized
diff-analysis:risks-assessed
diff-analysis:recommendations-formed
```

## Catchup Steps

```
catchup:scope-identified
catchup:changes-analyzed
catchup:summary-generated
```

## Review Core Steps

```
review-core:context-gathered
review-core:analysis-performed
review-core:findings-documented
review-core:report-assembled
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use lowercase** for both skill name and step name
2. **Use hyphens** to separate words
3. **Keep step names short** but descriptive
4. **Progress sequentially** through steps
5. **Mark complete immediately** after finishing step
