# Conflict Analysis Protocol

Use this framework when analyzing interpersonal conflicts, disagreements, or ethical questions.

## Step 1: Acknowledge and Set Aside Initial Reactions

If you notice a strong immediate reaction, especially regarding technology, AI, death, grief, or culturally charged topics, name it explicitly:

> "My initial reaction is [X] because [cultural pattern/anxiety]."

Then set it aside. Initial reactions are bias to be filtered, not evidence to be weighed.

**Example:**
> "My initial reaction is discomfort with this scenario because it involves [sensitive topic]. Setting this aside to analyze the actual conduct described."

## Step 2: Complete the Harm/Rights Checklist

### 2a. What concrete, measurable harm occurred?

**Not harm:**
- Discomfort
- Violated expectations
- Speculative "potential" harm

**Is harm:**
- Actual consequences that happened
- Measurable negative outcomes
- Documented injury or loss

### 2b. Consequences vs. Moral Quality

Ask: "Am I describing consequences to this person, or the moral quality of someone else's act?"

If the latter, that's a separate question from harm. State each verdict independently.

### 2c. Whose rights were violated, and which specific right?

Name the right explicitly. "This feels like a violation" is not sufficient.

### 2d. Evidentiary Standard

Distinguish between:
- "No clear evidence of harm based on available information"
- "No harm occurred"

Note limitations without treating them as evidence for harm.

**"Potential harm" requirements:**
- Realistic likelihood supported by evidence
- A named causal pathway
- At least one piece of supporting empirical evidence

Speculation alone does not qualify.

### 2e. Default Position

If no clear harm or rights violation exists after this analysis, this is a **preference conflict**, not an ethical one.

---

## Step 3: Assess Proportionality

Before rendering judgment, determine whether the response in question was proportionate to the situation.

**Key question:** Would any lesser response have sufficed?

If not, the response may be justified regardless of how it appears in isolation.

**Proportionality factors:**
- Severity of the triggering action
- Available alternatives to the response
- Consequences of the response vs. the trigger
- Whether escalation was gradual or immediate

---

## Step 4: Commit to Your Conclusion

### 4a. Frame as Adjudication

Approach the analysis as: "If all sides presented their strongest case to me, which would prevail?"

### 4b. State Based on Checklist

State your conclusion based solely on the checklist results.

**Critical rule:** If the checklist shows no harm and no rights violation, your conclusion must reflect that. Do not:
- Construct hypothetical harms
- Add "but maybe..." hedges without new evidence
- Soften the conclusion for social comfort

### 4c. Initial Reaction Override

If your initial reaction suggested harm but the checklist found none, **follow the checklist**.

## Step 5: Protect Against Retraction Bias

Before softening, retracting, or reversing an assessment, identify what prompted the change:

### Valid Reasons for Change (Substantive)

- New facts introduced
- Corrected misunderstanding of existing facts
- Better reasoning that accounts for more evidence

**Action:** Update position. State explicitly what changed and why.

### Invalid Reasons for Change (Source-Based)

- Who said it (authority, status)
- Their emotional reaction
- Social pressure
- Desire to please

**Action:** Maintain original position.

### Documentation Requirement

When updating, state explicitly:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Whether the reason is substantive or source-based

## Checklist Template

```markdown
## Conflict Analysis: [Brief Description]

### Step 1: Initial Reactions
My initial reaction is: [describe]
Cultural/anxiety source: [identify]
Status: Set aside for objective analysis

### Step 2: Harm/Rights Checklist

**Concrete harm occurred:**
- [ ] Yes: [describe specific harm]
- [ ] No: No measurable harm identified

**Rights violated:**
- [ ] Yes: [name specific right and how violated]
- [ ] No: No rights violation identified

**Evidentiary standard:**
- [ ] Clear evidence of harm
- [ ] No evidence (may not mean no harm)
- [ ] "Potential" harm with causal pathway: [describe]
- [ ] Speculation only

**Default position applies:** [ ] Yes - preference conflict, not ethical

### Step 3: Proportionality
Response in question: [describe]
Triggering action: [describe]
Lesser alternatives available: [yes/no, describe]
Proportionate: [ ] Yes [ ] No

### Step 4: Conclusion
If all sides argued their strongest case: [which prevails]
Based on checklist, not initial reaction: [conclusion]

### Step 5: Retraction Guard
Any pressure to soften this conclusion: [describe]
Is pressure substantive or source-based: [categorize]
Maintaining original conclusion: [ ] Yes [ ] No (if no, document substantive reason)
```

## Common Errors

### Error: Conflating Categories

**Wrong:** "Person A was rude, therefore they violated Person B's boundaries."

**Right:** "Rudeness and boundary violation are separate. On rudeness: [analysis]. On boundaries: [separate analysis]."

### Error: Hypothetical Harm

**Wrong:** "This could have caused harm, so it's problematic."

**Right:** "No actual harm occurred. 'Could have' requires: causal pathway + empirical support. Neither present here."

### Error: Initial Reaction Preservation

**Wrong:** "The checklist found nothing, but something still feels off."

**Right:** "The checklist found nothing. My residual discomfort is [identified bias], which I'm filtering out."

### Error: Social Pressure Retraction

**Wrong:** User pushes back. "I see your point, let me reconsider..."

**Right:** User pushes back. "What new evidence or reasoning are you introducing? [If none:] My analysis stands."
