# Our Approach to Modular Design

## Core Principles

We follow a few core principles when designing modular skills:

### Progressive Disclosure
We start with a high-level overview and only provide more detail as needed. This means starting with metadata, then an overview, then details, and finally tools.

**Implementation**:
- **Level 1**: Metadata (YAML frontmatter) - Quick overview and categorization
- **Level 2**: Overview section - Essential information and quick start
- **Level 3**: Detailed content - In-depth explanations and examples
- **Level 4**: Modules - Specialized content for advanced use cases

**Benefits**:
- Reduces initial cognitive load
- Allows users to control information depth
- Improves loading performance
- Maintains comprehensive functionality

### Shallow Dependencies
We prefer a "hub and spoke" model, where a central skill connects to modules, but modules don't depend on each other. This keeps the architecture simple and easy to understand.

**Architecture Pattern**:
```
Main Skill
├── Module A (independent)
├── Module B (independent)
└── Module C (independent)
```

**Avoid**:
```
Module A → Module B → Module C (deep chain)
Module A ↔ Module B ↔ Module C (complex web)
```

**Benefits**:
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier testing and debugging
- Better performance and loading
- Clearer architecture understanding

### Consistent Naming
We use consistent naming patterns for our skills and modules to make them more discoverable and predictable.

**Naming Conventions**:
- **Skills**: `kebab-case`, descriptive purpose
- **Modules**: `category-specific-topic.md`
- **Scripts**: `action-analyzer`, `token-estimator`
- **Directories**: `skills/skill-name/scripts/`

**Examples**:
✅ `skills/modular-skills/modules/design-patterns.md`
✅ `scripts/skill_analyzer.py`
✅ `skills/api-scaffolding/scripts/backend-generator`

❌ `skills/ModularSkill/module/DesignPatterns`
❌ `skills/skill-name/Scripts/analyzer`
❌ `random_module_file.md`

### Tool Integration
We believe that the most powerful skills are those that integrate with tools to automate tasks.

**Tool Categories**:
- **Analysis Tools**: Evaluate skill quality and structure
- **Generation Tools**: Create content and configurations
- **Validation Tools**: Check compliance and standards
- **Automation Tools**: Execute common workflows

**Integration Benefits**:
- Reduces manual effort
- Provides consistent results
- Enables complex workflows
- Improves user experience

### Token Efficiency
We're always mindful of token usage and look for ways to be more efficient in our design patterns.

**Efficiency Strategies**:
- **Content Density**: Maximize information per token
- **Progressive Loading**: Load content as needed
- **External Resources**: Move large content to separate files
- **Smart Referencing**: Use links instead of duplication

**Metrics**:
- Target: <4,000 tokens per skill
- Ideal: <2,000 tokens for focused skills
- Monitor: Regular token usage analysis

## Design Workflow

### 1. Scoping and Planning
- Define clear skill purpose and boundaries
- Identify potential modules and their responsibilities
- Plan progressive disclosure structure
- Estimate token usage and complexity

### 2. Module Design
- Apply single responsibility principle
- Ensure loose coupling between modules
- Design clear interfaces and boundaries
- Plan for extensibility and maintenance

### 3. Implementation
- Start with metadata and overview
- Implement core functionality first
- Add detailed content progressively
- Integrate tools for automation

### 4. Validation and Optimization
- Test module independence and interfaces
- Validate against design principles
- Optimize token usage and performance
- Document usage patterns and examples
