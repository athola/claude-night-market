## Detailed Frameworks

### Luhmann's Zettelkasten

**Source**: Niklas Luhmann - Sociologist, 70+ books, 90,000+ notes

**Core Idea**: Atomic notes with explicit links create a "conversation partner" that surfaces unexpected connections.

**Key Principles**:
- **Atomicity**: One idea per note
- **Linking**: Notes connect to other notes, not just categories
- **Own words**: Rewrite in your understanding, never copy
- **Unique identifiers**: Every note has permanent address
- **Emergence**: Structure emerges from links, not imposed hierarchy

**Note Types**:
| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Fleeting | Quick capture | "Idea: cognitive load applies to skills" |
| Literature | Reference to source | "Sweller 1988 argues..." |
| Permanent | Processed, atomic insight | "Cognitive load limits skill file size" |
| Structure | Index/hub notes | "MOC: Skill Design Principles" |

**The Process**:
```
1. Capture fleeting notes throughout day
2. Process into permanent notes (rewrite, atomize)
3. Link to existing notes (where does this connect?)
4. Add to structure notes (entry points)
5. Review and discover connections
```

**Use When**: Building long-term knowledge base, research, writing projects.

### Ahrens' Smart Notes

**Source**: Sönke Ahrens - "How to Take Smart Notes" (2017)

**Core Idea**: Writing is thinking; note-taking should support writing output.

**Key Principles**:
- **Writing as thinking**: You don't write up ideas, you think through writing
- **Bottom-up structure**: Let topics emerge from notes
- **Slip-box as partner**: External thinking system
- **Focus on output**: Notes serve future writing

**The Workflow**:
```
Reading → Fleeting Notes → Literature Notes → Permanent Notes → Writing
```

**Quality Criteria for Permanent Notes**:
- Could someone else understand it without context?
- Is it written in complete sentences?
- Does it stand on its own?
- Does it connect to existing notes?

**Writing Process**:
1. Collect relevant permanent notes
2. Arrange in sequence
3. Turn sequence into draft
4. Edit and refine

**Use When**: Academic writing, knowledge synthesis, developing arguments.

### Bush's Memex & Associative Trails

**Source**: Vannevar Bush - "As We May Think" (1945)

**Core Idea**: Human mind works by association; tools should support trails of thought.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Associative indexing**: Link by meaning, not alphabet
- **Trails**: Paths through information, shareable
- **Personal library**: All knowledge accessible, connected
- **Selection vs. creation**: Value in curating paths

**Modern Applications**:
| Memex Concept | Modern Implementation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Associative links | Hyperlinks, backlinks |
| Trails | Curated reading paths, playlists |
| Personal library | Personal wikis, note apps |
| Selection devices | Search, tags, filters |

**Use When**: Designing knowledge systems, understanding hypertext principles.

### Allen's GTD (Getting Things Done)

**Source**: David Allen - "Getting Things Done" (2001)

**Core Idea**: Capture everything; mind is for having ideas, not holding them.

**The Five Steps**:
```
1. CAPTURE    - Get everything out of your head
2. CLARIFY    - What is it? Is it actionable?
3. ORGANIZE   - Put it where it belongs
4. REFLECT    - Review regularly
5. ENGAGE     - Do with confidence
```

**The Two-Minute Rule**: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.

**Clarify Decision Tree**:
```
Is it actionable?
├── NO → Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Trash
└── YES → What's the next action?
    ├── Multi-step? → It's a Project
    └── Single step?
        ├── <2 min? → Do it now
        ├── Delegate? → Waiting For
        └── Defer? → Next Actions (by context)
```

**Use When**: Action-oriented knowledge, task management, reducing cognitive load.

### Forte's PARA & Second Brain

**Source**: Tiago Forte - "Building a Second Brain" (2022)

**Core Idea**: Organize by actionability, not topic. Progressive summarization for retrieval.

**PARA System**:
| Folder | Contains | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **P**rojects | Active outcomes | Weeks |
| **A**reas | Ongoing responsibilities | Indefinite |
| **R**esources | Useful references | As needed |
| **A**rchive | Inactive items | Done |

**Progressive Summarization**:
```
Layer 0: Original source
Layer 1: Bolded passages (10-20%)
Layer 2: Highlighted from bold (10-20% of bold)
Layer 3: Executive summary (your words)
Layer 4: Remix (original synthesis)
```

**CODE Method**:
- **C**apture: Save resonant information
- **O**rganize: Put in PARA folder
- **D**istill: Progressive summarization
- **E**xpress: Create output

**Use When**: Digital knowledge management, balancing capture and retrieval.

## Selection Matrix

| Your Goal | Primary Framework | Supporting |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Long-term knowledge building | Zettelkasten | Ahrens |
| Writing/research output | Ahrens | Zettelkasten |
| Task/action management | GTD | PARA |
| Digital organization | PARA | GTD |
| System design | Bush Memex | Zettelkasten |
| Reducing overwhelm | GTD | PARA |

## Knowledge System Template

Blended approach for a knowledge base:

```markdown
## Knowledge System Design

### Capture Layer (GTD + PARA)
- Inbox: Quick capture without friction
- Two-minute rule for processing
- Daily processing to zero

### Organization (PARA + Zettelkasten)
- Projects: Active work with deadlines
- Areas: Ongoing responsibilities
- Notes: Atomic, linked permanent notes
- Archive: Completed/inactive

### Connection (Zettelkasten)
- Every note links to 2+ existing notes
- Structure notes (MOCs) for entry points
- Tags for cross-cutting themes
- Regular gardening/review

### Output (Ahrens + Progressive Summary)
- Progressive summarization of sources
- Assemble notes for projects
- Write from accumulated notes
```

## For Memory-Palace Plugin

Specific applications:

| Memory-Palace Feature | Methodology Source |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Knowledge nodes | Zettelkasten atomicity |
| Backlinks | Luhmann's linking |
| Daily notes | GTD capture |
| MOC/Index notes | Zettelkasten structure notes |
| Project organization | PARA |
| Search/retrieval | Progressive summarization |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Collector's fallacy**: Saving without processing
- **Tagging obsession**: Tags without links
- **Hierarchy prison**: Rigid folders killing discovery
- **Perfect system seeking**: Setup > usage
- **Copy-paste notes**: No rewriting = no understanding
- **Orphan notes**: Notes without connections die
