# Shared Patterns

Reusable patterns and templates for skill and hook development.

## Purpose

This skill provides shared patterns that are referenced by other skills in the abstract plugin. It follows DRY principles by centralizing common patterns.

## Pattern Categories

### Validation Patterns

See [modules/validation-patterns.md](modules/validation-patterns.md) for:
- Input validation templates
- Schema validation patterns
- Error reporting formats

### Error Handling

See [modules/error-handling.md](modules/error-handling.md) for:
- Exception hierarchies
- Error message formatting
- Recovery strategies

### Testing Templates

See [modules/testing-templates.md](modules/testing-templates.md) for:
- Unit test scaffolding
- Integration test patterns
- Mock fixtures

### Workflow Patterns

See [modules/workflow-patterns.md](modules/workflow-patterns.md) for:
- Checklist templates
- Feedback loop patterns
- Progressive disclosure structures

## Usage

Reference these patterns from other skills:

```markdown
For validation patterns, see the `shared-patterns` skill's
[validation-patterns](../shared-patterns/modules/validation-patterns.md) module.
```

## When to Add Patterns Here

Add a pattern to this skill when:
- It's used by 3+ other skills
- It's boilerplate that shouldn't be duplicated
- It defines a standard that should be consistent

Do NOT add patterns that are:
- Specific to one skill
- Still evolving (wait for stability)
- Context-dependent (different skills need variations)
