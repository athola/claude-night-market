## Deployment Steps

After passing all gates:

### 1. Final Review

```bash
# Review checklist completion
cat deployment-checklist.md

# Verify all gates marked complete
grep "\[x\]" deployment-checklist.md
```

### 2. Version Tag

```bash
# Tag release
git tag -a skill-name-v1.0.0 -m "Release skill-name v1.0.0"

# Push tag
git push origin skill-name-v1.0.0
```

### 3. Documentation Update

```bash
# Update changelog
echo "## v1.0.0 - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> CHANGELOG.md
echo "- Initial release" >> CHANGELOG.md

# Update registry (if applicable)
# Add to skill registry/catalog
```

### 4. Deployment

```bash
# Copy to deployment location
cp -r skill-name ~/.claude/skills/

# Or install via package manager
claude-skills install skill-name

# Verify installation
claude-skills list | grep skill-name
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Test in production environment
# Run smoke tests
# Verify skill activates correctly
# Confirm expected behavior
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues discovered post-deployment:

### Immediate Actions

1. **Document Issue**
   - Exact failure observed
   - Reproduction steps
   - Impact assessment

2. **Rollback Decision**
   - Minor issue: Hot fix acceptable?
   - Major issue: Immediate rollback required?

3. **Execute Rollback** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version
   git revert skill-name-v1.0.0

   # Or restore previous version
   cp -r skill-name.backup ~/.claude/skills/skill-name
   ```

### Fix and Redeploy

1. Fix issue in development
2. Re-run affected gate checks
3. Update version number
4. Re-deploy with new version

## Success Criteria Summary

**Minimum requirements for deployment:**

1.  **Empirical Testing**: 3+ baseline scenarios, ≥50% improvement, 3+ consecutive 100% compliance tests
2.  **Structure**: Valid YAML, <500 lines, proper file organization
3.  **Description**: Third person, "Use when" clause, 200-400 chars, discovery optimized
4.  **Content**: Clear overview, examples, anti-rationalization, no orphans
5.  **Validation**: Passes `skill_validator.py` with exit code 0 or 1
6.  **Integration**: Loads without errors, no conflicts, workflows tested
7.  **Documentation**: Complete user and developer docs
8.  **Standards**: Follows best practices, ethical review passed

**Any gate failure = DO NOT DEPLOY**

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1: Active Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor activation rates
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Watch for unexpected behaviors
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Track compliance rates

### Week 2-4: Adjustment Period

- [ ] Identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Plan updates if needed
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### Month 2+: Maintenance

- [ ] Periodic regression testing
- [ ] Update for new best practices
- [ ] Incorporate user feedback
- [ ] Maintain compatibility

## Continuous Improvement

After deployment, track:

1. **Activation Success Rate**: How often skill activates when it should
2. **Compliance Rate**: How often Claude follows all requirements
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback and issue reports
4. **Performance**: Token usage, latency, context efficiency
5. **Maintenance Cost**: Time spent on updates and fixes

Use metrics to guide future improvements.
