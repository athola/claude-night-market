## Feature Timeline

### Claude Code 2.1.39 (February 2026)

**New Features**:
- ✅ **Nested Session Guard**: Claude Code now detects and prevents launching inside another Claude Code session
  - **Behavior**: If `CLAUDECODE=1` is already set in the environment (indicating an active session), launching `claude` will warn or block
  - **Impact**: Prevents accidental recursive session spawning that could cause confusion, resource waste, or context corruption
  - **Affected**: `conjure:agent-teams` spawning patterns — teammate sessions launched via tmux are unaffected because tmux creates independent shell environments
  - **Action Required**: Workflows that intentionally nest `claude` invocations (e.g., `claude -p` inside a `claude` session for quick queries) should be aware of this guard
  - **Note**: Agent teams set `CLAUDECODE=1` automatically — the guard distinguishes between intentional team spawning (via tmux panes) and accidental recursive invocation

- ✅ **OTel Speed Attribute**: Fast mode now tagged in OpenTelemetry events and trace spans via a `speed` attribute
  - **Impact**: Observability integrations can distinguish between fast mode and normal mode requests
  - **Affected**: Monitoring and observability documentation
  - **Action Required**: None — progressive enhancement for users with OTel tracing configured

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Agent Teams Model Fix for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry**: Teammate agents now use correct model identifiers on non-Anthropic-API providers
  - **Previous Bug**: Agent teams on Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Foundry would use wrong model identifiers (e.g., non-qualified model IDs), causing 400 errors or falling back to wrong models ([#23499](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23499), [#5108](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5108))
  - **Now Fixed**: Model identifiers correctly qualified for each provider (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` for Bedrock)
  - **Impact**: Agent teams now usable on enterprise cloud providers
  - **Affected**: `conjure:agent-teams` — added provider compatibility note to spawning patterns
  - **Action Required**: None — passive fix, existing `--model` flags work correctly

- ✅ **MCP Image Content Streaming Crash Fixed**: MCP tools returning image content during streaming no longer crash
  - **Previous Bug**: If an MCP tool returned image data while streaming was active, the response parser crashed
  - **Now Fixed**: Image content blocks handled correctly in streaming mode
  - **Impact**: MCP integrations with visual content (screenshots, diagrams) now work reliably
  - **Affected**: `scry:browser-recording` and any MCP-based image workflows
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Hook Exit Code 2 Stderr Now Displayed**: Hook blocking errors (exit code 2) now correctly show stderr output to the user
  - **Previous Bug**: When hooks returned exit code 2 (block decision), the stderr message explaining why the action was blocked was silently swallowed — users saw generic "hook error" instead of the hook's explanation ([#10964](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10964), [#10412](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10412))
  - **Now Fixed**: Stderr from exit code 2 hooks is properly displayed to the user, including from plugin-installed hooks
  - **Impact**: Hook developers can now rely on exit code 2 blocking with informative user-facing messages
  - **Affected**: `abstract:hook-authoring` — updated with exit code 2 blocking documentation
  - **Affected**: All ecosystem hooks that use blocking decisions (conserve, sanctum, imbue, hookify rules)
  - **Action Required**: None — existing hooks that use exit code 2 will now have their messages properly displayed

- ✅ **Improved Model Error Messages for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry**: Error messages now include fallback suggestions when model requests fail on enterprise providers
  - **Previous**: Generic error messages without actionable guidance
  - **Now**: Specific error with fallback model suggestions (e.g., "Try using `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-v1` instead")
  - **Impact**: Better debugging experience for enterprise users
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **`/resume` Session Previews Show Clean Command Names**: Session preview no longer displays raw XML tags
  - **Previous Bug**: Session previews in `/resume` showed raw `<command-name>` XML tags instead of readable skill/command names
  - **Now Fixed**: Clean, readable command names displayed
  - **Impact**: Better session management UX — previously documented in 2.1.33 for a similar XML rendering issue
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` — improved resume experience
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **`/resume` No Longer Shows Interrupt Messages as Titles**: Session titles derived from interrupts no longer pollute the resume list
  - **Previous Bug**: If a session was interrupted mid-execution, the interrupt message could become the session title shown in `/resume`
  - **Now Fixed**: Interrupt messages filtered from session title derivation
  - **Impact**: Cleaner session list in `/resume`
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Plugin Browse "Space to Toggle" Hint Fixed**: Already-installed plugins no longer show misleading toggle hint
  - **Previous Bug**: Browsing plugins showed "Space to Toggle" for plugins that were already installed, implying they could be toggled off (they need to be uninstalled)
  - **Now Fixed**: Correct action hint shown based on plugin state
  - **Impact**: Plugin management UX improvement
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Fatal Errors Now Displayed**: Fatal errors are no longer silently swallowed
  - **Previous Bug**: Some fatal errors were caught and discarded, leaving users with no indication of what went wrong
  - **Now Fixed**: Fatal errors properly surfaced to the user
  - **Impact**: Better debugging experience for all users
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Process No Longer Hangs After Session Close**: Fixed process remaining alive after session terminates
  - **Previous Bug**: Under certain conditions, the Claude Code process would hang after the session was closed, requiring manual termination
  - **Now Fixed**: Clean process exit on session close
  - **Impact**: Improved reliability for CI/CD pipelines and scripted workflows
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Terminal Rendering Improvements**: Multiple rendering fixes in this release
  - **Character loss at screen boundary**: Characters at the edge of the terminal screen are no longer lost during rendering
  - **Blank lines in verbose transcript**: Verbose transcript view no longer shows spurious blank lines
  - **General performance**: Terminal rendering performance improved across the board
  - **Impact**: Better visual experience, especially during long-running sessions
  - **Action Required**: None

**Notes**:
- The nested session guard is an important safety feature — but it does not affect agent teams or subagent workflows since those use tmux-based or Task tool-based isolation
- The hook exit code 2 stderr fix is significant for plugin developers — blocking hooks can now provide meaningful user-facing messages reliably
- The Agent Teams model fix makes multi-agent workflows viable on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry for the first time
- Terminal rendering improvements continue from 2.1.38's VS Code scroll fix
- Recommended version bumped to 2.1.39+ due to hook stderr fix and agent teams reliability

### Claude Code 2.1.38 (February 2026)

**Security Fixes**:
- 🔒 **Heredoc Delimiter Parsing Hardened**: Improved delimiter parsing to prevent command smuggling via crafted heredoc delimiters
  - **Previous Risk**: Specially crafted heredoc delimiters could potentially inject commands during bash tool execution
  - **Now Fixed**: Delimiter parsing validates and sanitizes heredoc boundaries before execution
  - **Security Impact**: Closes a potential command injection vector in bash tool heredoc handling
  - **Affected**: Ecosystem files using heredoc patterns for commit messages, PR bodies, and multi-line output (sanctum rules, commit-messages skill, pr-prep skill, do-issue command) — all benefit automatically
  - **Action Required**: None — passive security improvement, no pattern changes needed
  - **Note**: The `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` pattern recommended by sanctum remains safe and is now more robustly handled

- 🔒 **Sandbox Blocks Writes to `.claude/skills` Directory**: Skills directory is now read-only when sandbox mode is active
  - **Previous Behavior**: Sandbox mode allowed writes to `.claude/skills/`, enabling runtime skill creation/modification
  - **Now Blocked**: Write, Edit, and file creation operations targeting `.claude/skills/` are rejected in sandbox mode
  - **Security Impact**: Prevents runtime injection of malicious skills that could alter Claude's behavior
  - **Affected**: `abstract:skill-authoring` — updated with sandbox write restriction note
  - **Affected**: `abstract:create-skill` — skill creation requires non-sandbox mode or `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`
  - **Action Required**: Workflows that dynamically create skills must either disable sandbox or use pre-deployment skill installation
  - **Note**: Skills installed via plugin marketplace are unaffected — this only blocks runtime file writes to the skills directory
  - **Clarification**: This blocks writes to `.claude/skills/` within the sandbox path (project-level). User-level `~/.claude/skills/logs/` writes (e.g., skill execution logging by abstract's PostToolUse hook) are outside the sandbox boundary and remain unaffected

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **VS Code Terminal Scroll-to-Top Regression Fixed**: VS Code extension terminal no longer scrolls to top unexpectedly
  - **Previous Bug** (2.1.37): Terminal would jump to the top of output history during interaction, losing the user's scroll position
  - **Now Fixed**: Terminal scroll position maintained correctly in VS Code extension
  - **Impact**: Passive UX fix — no ecosystem changes needed
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Tab Key Autocomplete Restored**: Tab key now correctly autocompletes instead of queueing slash commands
  - **Previous Bug**: Pressing Tab would queue a slash command instead of triggering autocomplete, disrupting the expected interaction flow
  - **Now Fixed**: Tab key behavior restored to autocomplete (consistent with standard terminal behavior)
  - **Impact**: Passive UX fix — skills and commands invoked via `/` menu are unaffected
  - **Action Required**: None

- ✅ **Bash Permission Matching for Env Variable Wrappers**: Permission rules now correctly match commands prefixed with environment variable assignments
  - **Previous Bug**: Commands like `NODE_ENV=production npm test` or `FORCE_COLOR=1 jest` would not match permission rules expecting `npm test` or `jest` — resulting in unexpected permission prompts or denials ([#15292](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/15292), [#15777](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/15777))
  - **Now Fixed**: Environment variable prefixes (e.g., `KEY=value command`) are stripped during permission matching, so the base command matches existing rules
  - **Impact**: Permission rules using wildcard patterns like `Bash(npm *)` or `Bash(jest *)` now correctly match env-prefixed invocations
  - **Affected**: `abstract:hook-authoring` — updated with env wrapper matching note
  - **Affected**: `hookify:writing-rules` — rule patterns benefit automatically (no changes needed)
  - **Action Required**: None — existing permission rules now work correctly for a broader set of command invocations

- ✅ **Text Between Tool Uses Preserved (Non-Streaming)**: Text output between consecutive tool calls no longer disappears
  - **Previous Bug**: When not using streaming mode (e.g., SDK integrations, `--output-format json`), text generated between tool uses was silently dropped
  - **Now Fixed**: All inter-tool text is correctly preserved and displayed
  - **Impact**: SDK integrations and non-streaming pipelines now receive complete output
  - **Action Required**: None — passive fix, no workarounds existed

- ✅ **VS Code Duplicate Sessions on Resume Fixed**: Resuming sessions in VS Code extension no longer creates duplicate session entries
  - **Previous Bug**: Each resume in VS Code could create a duplicate session entry, cluttering the session list
  - **Now Fixed**: Resume correctly reuses the existing session without duplication
  - **Impact**: Cleaner session management in VS Code extension
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` — updated troubleshooting section with version note
  - **Action Required**: None

**Notes**:
- The heredoc delimiter hardening is a defense-in-depth security fix — the recommended `<<'EOF'` quoting pattern was already safe, but edge cases with crafted delimiters are now properly handled
- Sandbox `.claude/skills` write blocking is a significant security boundary — any plugin workflow that generates skills at runtime needs to account for this
- The env variable wrapper permission fix resolves a common friction point for CI/CD and test workflows that set environment variables inline
- Recommended version bumped to 2.1.38+ due to the heredoc security fix and sandbox hardening

### Claude Code 2.1.34 (February 2026)

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Agent Teams Render Crash Fix**: Changing agent teams setting mid-session no longer crashes Claude Code
  - **Previous Bug**: Toggling `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` or `teammateMode` between renders caused a crash
  - **Now Fixed**: Settings changes handled gracefully during render cycles
  - **Impact**: Passive stability fix — no ecosystem changes needed
  - **Action Required**: None

- 🔒 **Sandbox Permission Bypass Fix**: Commands excluded from sandboxing no longer bypass permission prompts in auto-allow mode
  - **Previous Bug**: When `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` was enabled, commands running outside the sandbox (via `sandbox.excludedCommands` or `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`) were auto-allowed without permission prompts
  - **Now Fixed**: Unsandboxed commands always go through normal permission flow, regardless of auto-allow mode
  - **Security Impact**: Commands like `docker` (commonly in `excludedCommands`) now properly prompt before running unsandboxed
  - **Affected**: `hookify:block-destructive-git` example — updated rationale text (previously described buggy behavior as expected)
  - **Action Required**: None for production workflows — the fix makes sandbox auto-allow mode safer by default

**Notes**:
- The sandbox permission fix is a security-relevant behavioral change — users relying on auto-allow mode now have proper permission gates for unsandboxed commands
- Agent teams render crash was an internal UI stability issue with no impact on coordination patterns
- Recommended version bumped to 2.1.34+ due to the security fix

### Claude Code 2.1.33 (February 2026)

- ✅ **Task(agent_type) Sub-Agent Restrictions**: Restrict sub-agent spawning via tools frontmatter
  - **Syntax**: `Task(specific-agent)` in agent `tools:` list
  - **Impact**: Fine-grained control over delegation chains
  - **Affected**: `abstract:plugin-validator` updated with validation for new syntax
  - **Affected**: `conserve:mcp-subagents` and `conserve:subagent-coordination` updated with restriction patterns
  - **Action Required**: Consider adding restrictions to pipeline agents

- ✅ **Agent Memory Frontmatter**: Persistent memory for agents with scope control
  - **Syntax**: `memory: user|project|local` in agent frontmatter
  - **Impact**: Agents can record and recall memories across sessions
  - **Affected**: `abstract:plugin-validator` updated with memory field validation
  - **Affected**: memory-palace, sanctum, conserve, abstract agents updated with `memory: project`
  - **Action Required**: None — progressive enhancement, opt-in per agent

- ✅ **Plugin Name in Skill Descriptions**: Plugin name auto-displayed in `/skills` menu
  - **Impact**: Better skill discoverability, no need to repeat plugin name in descriptions
  - **Affected**: `abstract:skill-authoring` updated with guidance to avoid redundant plugin names
  - **Action Required**: None — cosmetic enhancement

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Agent Teammate Sessions in tmux**: Fixed send/receive for teammate sessions
- ✅ **Agent Teams Plan Warnings**: Fixed incorrect "not available" warnings
- ✅ **Thinking Interruption Fix**: New message during extended thinking no longer interrupts
- ✅ **API Proxy 404 Fix**: Streaming 404 errors no longer trigger non-streaming fallback
- ✅ **Proxy Settings for WebFetch**: Environment proxy settings now applied to HTTP requests
- ✅ **Resume Session Picker**: Shows clean titles instead of raw XML markup
- ✅ **API Error Messages**: Shows specific cause (ECONNREFUSED, SSL) instead of generic errors
- ✅ **Managed Settings Errors**: Invalid settings errors now surfaced to user

**Notes**:
- TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted hooks extend agent teams coordination capabilities
- Task(agent_type) provides governance over delegation chains — use for pipeline agents
- Agent memory is opt-in and does not overlap with Memory Palace structured knowledge

### Claude Code 2.1.32 (February 2026)

**New Model**:
- ✅ **Claude Opus 4.6**: New flagship model with 200K context (1M beta), 128K max output, adaptive thinking with effort controls
  - **Effort Controls**: 4 levels (low/medium/high/max) trade reasoning depth against speed/cost
  - **Adaptive Thinking**: `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` — Claude decides when and how deeply to think
  - **Server-Side Compaction**: Automatic API-level context summarization for infinite conversations
  - **Affected**: `abstract:model-optimization-guide` updated with Opus 4.6 capabilities and effort controls as escalation alternative
  - **Affected**: `abstract:escalation-governance` updated with effort controls as complementary axis
  - **Affected**: `conserve:mecw-principles` updated with variable context window thresholds

**New Features**:
- ✅ **Agent Teams (Research Preview)**: Multi-agent collaboration with lead/teammate roles
  - **Enable**: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
  - **Capabilities**: Shared task lists, inter-agent messaging, lead coordination
  - **Limitations**: No session resumption with teammates, one team per session, no nested teams, token-intensive
  - **Affected**: `conserve:subagent-coordination` updated with agent teams comparison and guidance
  - **Action Required**: None for production workflows — experimental feature

- ✅ **Automatic Memory Recording**: Claude records and recalls memories across sessions
  - **Impact**: Passive cross-session continuity without manual checkpoints
  - **Affected**: `memory-palace/README.md` updated with differentiation from native memory
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` updated with automatic memory section
  - **Affected**: `conserve:token-conservation` updated noting memory token overhead
  - **Action Required**: None — automatic behavior on first-party API

- ✅ **"Summarize from here"**: Partial conversation summarization via message selector
  - **Impact**: Middle ground between `/compact` (full) and `/new` (clean slate)
  - **Affected**: `conserve:token-conservation` step 4 updated with partial summarization option
  - **Affected**: `conserve:clear-context` updated as alternative before full auto-clear
  - **Affected**: `conserve:mecw-principles` updated with partial summarization reference

- ✅ **Skills from `--add-dir` Auto-Loaded**: Skills in `.claude/skills/` within additional directories now auto-discovered
  - **Previous**: Only CLAUDE.md from `--add-dir` was loaded (2.1.20)
  - **Now**: Skills also auto-discovered from additional directories
  - **Impact**: Better monorepo support — package-specific skills work with `--add-dir`
  - **Affected**: `abstract:skill-authoring` — monorepo skill patterns now fully supported

- ✅ **Skill Character Budget Scales**: 2% of context window instead of fixed limit
  - **Impact**: Larger context windows = more room for skill descriptions (200K → ~4K chars, 1M → ~20K chars)
  - **Affected**: `abstract:skill-authoring` updated with scaling budget table
  - **Action Required**: None — previously truncated skills may now display fully

- ✅ **`--resume` Re-uses `--agent`**: Resume preserves agent value from previous session
  - **Impact**: Agent-specific workflows resume seamlessly
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` updated with agent persistence note

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Heredoc JavaScript Template Literal Fix**: `${index + 1}` in heredocs no longer causes "Bad substitution"
  - **Previous Bug**: Heredocs containing JS template literals interrupted tool execution
  - **Now Fixed**: Bash tool handles template literals correctly
  - **Impact**: Passive fix — 8 ecosystem files using heredocs benefit automatically

- ✅ **@ File Completion Fix**: Fixed incorrect relative paths when running from subdirectories
- ✅ **Thai/Lao Spacing Vowels Fix**: Input rendering fix for Thai/Lao characters

**Notes**:
- Opus 4.6 effort controls provide a new cost/quality axis complementary to model escalation
- Agent teams are experimental — use Task tool patterns for production workflows
- Automatic memory overlaps with memory-palace but serves different purpose (session continuity vs structured knowledge)
- Skill budget scaling reduces pressure on aggressive description compression

### Claude Code 2.1.31 (February 2026)

**Behavioral Changes**:
- ✅ **Strengthened Dedicated Tool Preference**: System prompts now more aggressively guide toward Read, Edit, Glob, Grep instead of bash equivalents (cat, sed, grep, find)
  - **Previous (2.1.21)**: Initial file operation tool preference introduced
  - **Now (2.1.31)**: Guidance is stronger and more explicit — reduces unnecessary Bash command usage further
  - **Impact**: Skills/agents with bash-based file operation examples may see Claude prefer native tools instead
  - **Affected**: `conserve:ai-hygiene-auditor` pseudocode, `conserve:bloat-detector` patterns — added clarifying notes
  - **Action Taken**: Updated bloat-detector and ai-hygiene-auditor docs to clarify bash snippets are for external script execution

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **PDF Session Lock-Up Fix**: PDF-too-large errors no longer permanently lock sessions
  - **Previous Bug**: Oversized PDFs could make sessions completely unusable, requiring a new conversation
  - **Now Fixed**: Error handled gracefully with clear limits shown (100 pages max, 20MB max)
  - **Impact**: Sessions are more resilient during PDF-heavy workflows
  - **Affected**: `conserve:token-conservation` — updated with explicit PDF limits

- ✅ **Bash Sandbox "Read-only file system" Fix**: Bash commands no longer falsely report failure in sandbox mode
  - **Previous Bug**: Sandbox mode could cause spurious "Read-only file system" errors on valid commands
  - **Now Fixed**: Sandbox isolation no longer produces false-positive errors
  - **Impact**: Agents using Bash tool with sandbox mode enabled now get accurate results
  - **Action Required**: None — passive fix, no workarounds existed to remove

- ✅ **Plan Mode Crash Fix**: Entering plan mode no longer crashes when `~/.claude.json` is missing default fields
  - **Previous Bug**: Sessions became unusable after entering plan mode with incomplete project config
  - **Now Fixed**: Missing fields handled gracefully
  - **Affected**: `spec-kit:spec-writing` references plan mode — no changes needed

- ✅ **temperatureOverride Streaming Fix**: `temperatureOverride` now respected in streaming API path
  - **Previous Bug**: All streaming requests silently used default temperature (1.0) regardless of configured override
  - **Now Fixed**: Custom temperature correctly applied to streaming requests
  - **Impact**: SDK integrations using streaming with custom temperature will now produce different (correct) outputs
  - **Action Required**: None for ecosystem — but SDK users should verify their temperature-dependent workflows

- ✅ **LSP Shutdown/Exit Compatibility**: Fixed null params handling for strict language servers
  - **Previous Bug**: Language servers requiring non-null params for shutdown/exit (e.g., rust-analyzer, clangd) could fail
  - **Now Fixed**: Proper null-safe params sent during LSP lifecycle
  - **Impact**: Improved LSP stability for strict servers — benefits `pensive` and `sanctum` LSP workflows
  - **Affected**: LSP experimental status (Issue #72) — incrementally more stable

**UX Improvements**:
- ✅ **Session Resume Hint on Exit**: Claude Code now shows how to continue the conversation when exiting
  - **Impact**: Improved discoverability of `--resume` functionality
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` — users will discover resume patterns organically
  - **Action Taken**: Updated session-management skill with reference to this feature

- ✅ **Improved PDF/Request Error Messages**: Now shows actual limits (100 pages, 20MB) instead of generic errors
  - **Impact**: Better user experience during PDF and large request workflows
  - **Affected**: `conserve:token-conservation` — updated with explicit limits

- Reduced layout jitter when spinner appears/disappears during streaming
- Full-width (zenkaku) space input support from Japanese IME in checkbox selection
- Removed misleading Anthropic API pricing from model selector for third-party provider users

**Notes**:
- The strengthened tool preference reinforces 2.1.21's direction — ecosystem bash-based analysis scripts are unaffected (they run as subprocesses), but skills should prefer native tools for direct analysis
- PDF session lock-up was a critical reliability issue now resolved
- temperatureOverride fix may change outputs for SDK streaming integrations that previously defaulted to temperature 1.0
- LSP improvements incrementally improve the experimental feature's stability

### Claude Code 2.1.30 (February 2026)

**New Features**:
- ✅ **Read Tool PDF Pages Parameter**: `pages` parameter for targeted PDF reading (e.g., `pages: "1-5"`)
  - Large PDFs (>10 pages) now return lightweight reference when @-mentioned instead of inlining into context
  - **Affected**: `conserve:token-conservation` — new token-saving technique for PDF-heavy workflows
  - **Action Required**: Update token conservation guidance to recommend `pages` parameter for PDFs

- ✅ **Task Tool Metrics**: Token count, tool uses, and duration metrics now included in Task tool results
  - **Impact**: Subagent coordination can now measure actual efficiency instead of estimating
  - **Affected**: `conserve:subagent-coordination` efficiency calculations, `conserve:mcp-code-execution` coordination metrics
  - **Action Required**: Update subagent decision frameworks to incorporate real measured metrics from prior Task invocations

- ✅ **MCP OAuth Client Credentials**: Pre-configured OAuth for MCP servers without Dynamic Client Registration
  - **Usage**: `--client-id` and `--client-secret` with `claude mcp add`
  - **Use Case**: Slack and similar services that require pre-configured OAuth
  - **Affected**: `conjure:delegation-core` — new MCP authentication option for external services
  - **Action Required**: None — progressive enhancement for MCP server configuration

- ✅ **`/debug` Command**: Session troubleshooting command
  - **Impact**: New diagnostic tool for troubleshooting session issues
  - **Action Required**: None — reference in troubleshooting documentation

- ✅ **Expanded Read-Only Git Flags**: `--topo-order`, `--cherry-pick`, `--format`, `--raw` for `git log` and `git show`
  - **Impact**: Read-only agents can now produce structured git output and more precise change detection
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:git-workspace-agent`, `imbue:catchup`, `imbue:diff-analysis`
  - **Action Required**: None — progressive enhancement for git-based analysis agents

- ✅ **Improved TaskStop Display**: Shows stopped command/task description instead of generic "Task stopped"
  - **Impact**: Better debugging of multi-agent workflows when subagents are stopped
  - **Affected**: `conserve:subagent-coordination` monitoring patterns
  - **Action Required**: None — passive improvement

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Subagent SDK MCP Tool Access**: Fixed subagents not being able to access SDK-provided MCP tools
  - **Previous Bug**: SDK-provided MCP tools were not synced to shared application state, so subagents couldn't use them
  - **Now Fixed**: MCP tools properly synced across subagent boundaries
  - **Impact**: Any workflow delegating MCP tool usage to subagents was silently broken
  - **Affected**: `conserve:mcp-code-execution/mcp-subagents`, `conjure:delegation-core` subagent patterns
  - **Action Required**: Remove any workarounds for MCP tool access in subagents

- ✅ **Phantom "(no content)" Text Blocks**: Fixed empty blocks in API conversation history
  - **Previous Bug**: Phantom blocks wasted tokens and confused model reasoning
  - **Now Fixed**: Clean conversation history without empty blocks
  - **Impact**: More accurate MECW calculations, reduced token waste
  - **Affected**: `conserve:context-optimization` MECW threshold accuracy — passive improvement

- ✅ **Prompt Cache Invalidation**: Fixed cache not invalidating when tool descriptions/schemas changed
  - **Previous Bug**: Cache only invalidated on tool *name* changes, not description/schema changes
  - **Now Fixed**: Cache properly invalidates on any tool metadata change
  - **Impact**: More reliable behavior when MCP tool schemas evolve
  - **Action Required**: None — passive fix

- ✅ **Session Resume Memory**: 68% memory reduction for `--resume` via stat-based session loading
  - **Previous**: Full session index loaded into memory
  - **Now**: Lightweight stat-based loading with progressive enrichment
  - **Impact**: Faster resume for users with many sessions
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` — improved resume performance

- ✅ **Session Resume Hang Fix**: Fixed hang when resuming sessions with corrupted transcript files (parentUuid cycles)
  - **Impact**: More robust session resumption — no code changes needed

- Fixed 400 errors after `/login` with thinking blocks
- Fixed rate limit message showing incorrect "/upgrade" for Max 20x users
- Fixed permission dialogs stealing focus while typing
- Fixed Windows `.bashrc` regression for Bash commands

**UX Improvements**:
- `/model` now executes immediately instead of being queued
- Added reduced motion mode to config

**Notes**:
- Task tool metrics enable data-driven subagent delegation decisions — a significant improvement for MECW optimization
- SDK MCP tool fix resolves silent failures in subagent MCP workflows
- Prompt cache fix improves reliability for workflows with evolving MCP tool schemas
- Resume memory improvements benefit heavy session users

### Claude Code 2.1.29 (February 2026)

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Session Resume Performance**: Fixed startup performance issues when resuming sessions with `saved_hook_context`
  - **Root Cause**: Sessions accumulating `once: true` hook state (from skill/agent frontmatter hooks) experienced slow resume times as the saved context grew
  - **Impact**: Passive improvement for all ecosystem components using `once: true` hooks — no code changes needed
  - **Affected Components**: `conserve:context-optimization`, `conserve:bloat-scan`, `sanctum:commit-agent`, `sanctum:prepare-pr`, `sanctum:update-dependencies`, `sanctum:git-workspace-review`, `pensive:architecture-reviewer`, `abstract:plugin-validator`
  - **Action Required**: None — internal performance optimization with no API or behavioral changes

**Notes**: Pure performance fix. No breaking changes, no API changes, no schema changes.

### Claude Code 2.1.22–2.1.27 (February 2026)

Stabilization releases. Key changes:

- ✅ **PR-Linked Sessions** (2.1.27): `--from-pr` flag resumes sessions by PR number/URL; sessions auto-linked when using `gh pr create`
  - **Affected**: `sanctum:session-management` updated with PR session workflow pattern
- ✅ **Ripgrep Timeout Reporting** (2.1.23): Search timeouts now report errors instead of silently returning empty results
  - **Impact**: Grep tool results are more reliable; no ecosystem code changes needed
- ✅ **Async Hook Cancellation** (2.1.23): Pending async hooks properly cancelled when headless sessions end
  - **Impact**: No ecosystem hooks affected (all synchronous)
- ✅ **Structured Output Fix** (2.1.22): Fixed `--output-format json` in `-p` mode
- ✅ **Per-User Temp Directory Isolation** (2.1.23): Prevents permission conflicts on shared systems
- ✅ **Debug Logging** (2.1.27): Tool call failures and denials now in debug logs
- Various Bedrock/Vertex gateway fixes (2.1.25, 2.1.27), Windows fixes (2.1.27), UI fixes

**Notes**: No breaking changes. PR-linked sessions are a progressive enhancement for PR review workflows.

### [Claude Code 2.1.21](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2121) (February 2026)

**Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ **Auto-Compact Threshold Fix**: Auto-compact no longer triggers too early on models with large output token limits
  - **Previous Bug**: Models with large max output tokens (e.g., Opus) could see compaction trigger well below the expected ~160k threshold
  - **Now Fixed**: Effective context calculation properly accounts for output token reservation
  - **Affected**: `conserve:subagent-coordination` compaction threshold documentation updated

- ✅ **Task ID Reuse Fix**: Task IDs no longer reused after deletion
  - **Previous Bug**: Deleting a task and creating a new one could silently reuse the same ID, leaking old state

**New Features**:
- ⚠️ **LSP (Language Server Protocol) Tool**: Native code intelligence integration (**EXPERIMENTAL - See [Issue #72](https://github.com/athola/claude-night-market/issues/72)**)

  > **⚠️ CURRENT STATUS (v2.0.74-2.0.76):** LSP support is experimental with known bugs (race conditions, plugin loading failures, "No LSP server available" errors). **Recommend using Grep (ripgrep) as primary method** until LSP stabilizes. See "LSP Integration Patterns" section below for details.

  - **Capabilities**: Go-to-definition, find references, hover documentation
  - **Performance**: 50ms semantic searches (when working) vs. 100-500ms grep searches (reliable)
  - **Impact**: Semantic code navigation when functional, but unstable in current versions
  - **Affected Plugins**:
    - **pensive**: Enhanced code review with semantic analysis, impact detection, unused code identification
    - **sanctum**: Documentation updates with reference finding, API completeness verification
    - **conservation**: LSP queries more token-efficient than broad grep searches
    - **abstract**: Plugin developers should document LSP usage patterns
  - **Language Support**: TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, C#, PowerShell, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, BSL
  - **Activation**: Set `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` environment variable
  - **Documentation**: See "LSP Integration Patterns" section below
  - **Resources**:
    - [cclsp MCP server](https://github.com/ktnyt/cclsp) - MCP integration for LSP
    - [Official LSP Plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) - Anthropic's official LSP plugins (pyright-lsp, typescript-lsp, rust-analyzer-lsp, etc.)
  - **Examples**:
    ```bash
    # Enable LSP for session (from within a code project)
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1 claude

- ✅ **Terminal Setup Support**: Extended `/terminal-setup` compatibility
  - **Added Support**: Kitty, Alacritty, Zed, Warp terminals
  - **Impact**: Improved cross-terminal compatibility
  - **Affected**: Users on modern terminal emulators
  - **Documentation**: Run `/terminal-setup` to configure

**User Experience**:
- ✅ **Improved /context Visualization**: Skills/agents grouped by source plugin
  - **Display**: Shows plugin organization, slash commands, sorted token counts
  - **Benefits**:
    - Easier plugin discovery and context understanding
    - Better visibility into which plugins consume context
    - Improved MECW monitoring and optimization
  - **Affected**:
    - **conservation**: Update context optimization guidance
    - **abstract**: Plugin metadata more visible
  - **Documentation**: `conserve/skills/context-optimization/modules/mecw-principles.md`

- Added `ctrl+t` shortcut in `/theme` to toggle syntax highlighting on/off
- Added syntax highlighting info to theme picker
- Added guidance for macOS users when Alt shortcuts fail due to terminal configuration
- Improved macOS keyboard shortcuts to display 'opt' instead of 'alt'

**Security Fixes**:
- 🔒 **CRITICAL: Fixed skill allowed-tools enforcement**
  - **Previous Bug**: `allowed-tools` restrictions in skill frontmatter were NOT being applied
  - **Now Fixed**: Tool restrictions properly enforced for skills
  - **Security Impact**: Skills that assumed tool restrictions were actually exposing all tools
  - **Ecosystem Impact**: Currently no plugins use `allowed-tools` (verified via audit)
  - **Action Required**:
    - Plugin developers should review if any skills need tool restrictions
    - Consider using `allowed-tools` for security-sensitive skills
    - Distinguish between agent `tools:` (whitelist) and skill `allowed-tools:` (restrictions)
  - **Documentation**: See "Tool Restriction Patterns" section below
  - **Example**:
    ```yaml
    ---
    name: restricted-skill
    description: Skill that should not execute arbitrary code
    allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]  # Now properly enforced!
    ---
    ```
  - **Best Practices**:
    - Use `allowed-tools` for skills processing untrusted input
    - Restrict Bash/Write/Edit for read-only analysis skills
    - Document security assumptions in skill descriptions

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed visual bug in `/plugins discover` where list selection indicator showed while search box was focused
- Fixed a potential crash when syntax highlighting isn't initialized correctly
- Fixed Opus 4.5 tip incorrectly showing when user was already using Opus

**Notes**:
- LSP integration represents a paradigm shift from text-based to semantic code understanding
- `allowed-tools` fix closes a security gap - audit your skills if you assumed tool restrictions
- Improved /context visualization aids MECW compliance and plugin discoverability
- Terminal compatibility improvements benefit cross-platform development
