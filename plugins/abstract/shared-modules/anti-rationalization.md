# Anti-Rationalization Patterns

## Red Flags - Stop and Reconsider

When you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP. You are rationalizing.

| If You're Thinking... | The Reality Is... | Required Action |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| "This is a simple task" | Simple tasks compound into complex failures. | Check the skill anyway. |
| "I'll check skills after I understand more" | Skills tell you HOW to understand. | Check skills FIRST. |
| "I remember what this skill does" | Skills evolve. Your memory is stale. | Read the current version. |
| "This doesn't need the full workflow" | Partial workflows create inconsistency. | Follow completely or not at all. |
| "Let me just do this one thing first" | 'One thing' becomes scope creep. | Check skills BEFORE any action. |
| "The skill is overkill for this" | If a skill exists, someone needed it. | Use the skill. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Any action is a task. | Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE gathering context. | Check skills FIRST. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. | Skills prevent this. |
| "I can check skills later" | Later never comes. Now is the only time. | Check NOW. |

## The Iron Law

**If a skill might apply, even 1% chance, you MUST check it.**

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

## Common Bypass Patterns

### The "Quick Fix" Bypass
> "I'll just make this small change, no need for the full process."

**Reality**: Small changes cascade. The skill exists because someone learned this the hard way.

### The "Expert Override" Bypass
> "I know what I'm doing here, I don't need the checklist."

**Reality**: Experts make errors too. Checklists catch what expertise misses.

### The "Time Pressure" Bypass
> "We don't have time for the full workflow right now."

**Reality**: Skipping process creates rework. The "slow" way is usually faster.

### The "Edge Case" Bypass
> "This situation is different, the skill doesn't apply."

**Reality**: If you're uncertain, the skill probably applies. Check it.
