# Test Enhancement Module

## Overview

Improves existing tests by applying BDD patterns, adding edge cases, and increasing test quality. Transforms basic tests into comprehensive behavior specifications.

## Enhancement Strategies

### 1. BDD Pattern Application
Transforms traditional tests into BDD-style tests.
See [enhancement/bdd-transformation](enhancement/bdd-transformation.md) for detailed examples and guidelines.

### 2. Edge Case Expansion
Adds comprehensive edge case testing.
See [enhancement/edge-cases](enhancement/edge-cases.md) for systematic edge case patterns.

### 3. Test Organization
Improves test structure and maintainability.
See [enhancement/organization-patterns](enhancement/organization-patterns.md) for organizational best practices.

## Quality Enhancement Rules

### The Rule of Three
For every assertion, add:
1. **Positive case**: Expected behavior
2. **Negative case**: Error handling
3. **Edge case**: Boundary condition

### AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
```python
def test_workflow():
    # Arrange - Setup everything needed
    context = create_test_context()
    expected = prepare_expected_result()

    # Act - Perform the action
    result = perform_action(context)

    # Assert - Verify outcomes
    assert result == expected
```

### Test Data Factory Pattern
Create reusable test data factories for consistent test setup.

## Enhancement Checklist

For each existing test:
- [ ] Add BDD-style docstring with Given/When/Then
- [ ] Include edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Use descriptive test names
- [ ] Add appropriate fixtures
- [ ] Verify test independence
- [ ] Add performance assertions if relevant
- [ ] Include behavior documentation
- [ ] Mock external dependencies appropriately
