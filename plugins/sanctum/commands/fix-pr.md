# Enhanced PR Fix

<identification>
triggers: fix PR, address review, PR feedback, review comments

use_when:
- Responding to PR review comments systematically
- Iterating on PR after reviewer feedback
</identification>

A progressive workflow for addressing PR review feedback, following the attune pattern:
**analyze** → **triage** → **plan** → **fix** → **validate** → **complete**

## Quick Reference

```
/fix-pr                    # Full workflow
/fix-pr --from triage      # Skip analysis, start at triage
/fix-pr --to plan          # Stop after planning (dry run)
/fix-pr --scope minor      # Auto-skip steps for minor fixes
```

## Workflow Steps Overview

| Step | Purpose | Skip When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Analyze** | Fetch PR, comments, context | Already familiar with PR |
| **2. Triage** | Classify comments by type/priority | Single simple fix |
| **3. Plan** | Generate fix strategies | Fixes are obvious |
| **4. Fix** | Apply code changes | Just need validation |
| **5. Validate** | Run tests, version checks | Already validated |
| **6. Complete** | Threads, issues, summary | Just needed fixes |

## Intelligent Step-Skipping

The workflow auto-detects scope and suggests step-skipping:

**Minor scope** (1-2 simple comments):
- Skip: Analyze, Triage, Plan
- Run: Fix → Validate → Complete

**Medium scope** (3-5 comments, clear fixes):
- Skip: Analyze (if familiar)
- Run: Triage → Plan → Fix → Validate → Complete

**Major scope** (6+ comments, complex changes):
- Run all steps

```bash
# Detect scope automatically
/fix-pr --scope auto

# Override with explicit scope
/fix-pr --scope minor
/fix-pr --scope medium
/fix-pr --scope major
```

## Step 1: Analyze (Discovery & Context)

**Purpose**: Understand the PR and gather all review comments.

**Skip when**: You're already familiar with the PR and comments (e.g., you just received the review notification).

### 1.1 Identify Target PR

```bash
# Current branch or specified PR
gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,body,title
```

### 1.2 Check and Add PR Description (if missing)

Verify the PR has a description and add one if it's missing:

   ```bash
   # Check if PR has a description
   PR_BODY=$(gh pr view --json body -q .body)

   # If empty or whitespace-only, generate and add description
   if [[ -z "$(echo "$PR_BODY" | tr -d '[:space:]')" ]]; then
     echo "PR is missing a description. Generating one..."

     # Gather information for description generation
     PR_TITLE=$(gh pr view --json title -q .title)
     COMMIT_MSGS=$(git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD --format="%s" | head -10)
     FILE_STATS=$(git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD | tail -1)
     CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | head -20)

     # Create a temporary file for the description
     TEMP_DESC=$(mktemp)

     # Generate the description with actual content
     # This should be done by analyzing the actual PR data, not using placeholders
     cat > "$TEMP_DESC" << 'TEMPLATE_EOF'
## Summary

[Analyze commits and changes to write 1-3 sentences explaining what this PR does]

## Changes

[Generate bullet list from commit messages and changed files - replace with actual changes]

## Test Plan

[Generate verification steps based on what was changed]

- [ ] Quality gates pass: `make test && make lint`

---
*PR description auto-generated by /fix-pr*
TEMPLATE_EOF

     # Add the description to the PR using REST API (more reliable than gh pr edit)
     # Get repo info for API call
     REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
     PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

     gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUM}" -X PATCH -F body=@"$TEMP_DESC" --silent

     # Clean up
     rm -f "$TEMP_DESC"

     echo "✓ PR description added"
   fi
   ```

   **CRITICAL: Generate Real Content, Not Placeholders**

   When implementing this step, you MUST:
   1. **Analyze the actual PR data** - Don't just copy the template
   2. **Write the description to a temp file** - This preserves formatting
   3. **Use REST API instead of `gh pr edit`** - More reliable, avoids GraphQL permission issues

   **Step-by-step implementation:**

   ```bash
   # 1. Gather PR metadata
   PR_TITLE=$(gh pr view --json title -q .title)
   COMMITS=$(git log origin/main..HEAD --format="%s")
   FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD)
   STATS=$(git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD)

   # 2. Create temp file
   TEMP_DESC=$(mktemp)

   # 3. Write actual description (NOT placeholders!)
   cat > "$TEMP_DESC" << EOF
## Summary

${ACTUAL_SUMMARY_HERE}

## Changes

${ACTUAL_CHANGES_HERE}

## Test Plan

${ACTUAL_TEST_PLAN_HERE}

---
*PR description auto-generated by /fix-pr*
EOF

   # 4. Get repo/PR info for API call
   REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
   PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

   # 5. Apply using REST API (more reliable than gh pr edit)
   gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUM}" -X PATCH -F body=@"$TEMP_DESC" --silent

   # 6. Cleanup
   rm -f "$TEMP_DESC"
   ```

   **Description Generation Guidelines:**
   - **Summary**: 1-2 sentences explaining the purpose from commit messages
   - **Changes**: Bullet list derived from:
     - Commit message headlines
     - Changed file paths (group by feature/module)
     - Significant additions from git diff stats
   - **Test Plan**: Basic verification steps:
     - Unit tests for modified modules
     - Integration tests if multiple modules changed
     - Quality gates (lint, test, build)
   - Use conventional commit type from branch name or commits (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)

   **Common Formatting Issues and Solutions:**

   ❌ **WRONG - Escaped newlines in description:**
   ```json
   "## Summary\n\nThis adds a feature\n\n## Changes\n\n- Item 1"
   ```
   This happens when using `--body` with a string that gets JSON-escaped.

   ✅ **CORRECT - Using REST API with temp file:**
   ```bash
   # Write to file with real newlines
   cat > /tmp/pr-desc.md << EOF
## Summary

This adds a feature

## Changes

- Item 1
EOF

   # Use REST API (more reliable than gh pr edit which can silently fail)
   REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
   PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
   gh api "repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUM}" -X PATCH -F body=@/tmp/pr-desc.md
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - Use REST API (`gh api ... -X PATCH`) instead of `gh pr edit --body-file`
   - `gh pr edit` uses GraphQL which can silently fail due to token scope issues
   - Write content to a temp file first to preserve formatting
   - Use heredoc (<<EOF) or Write tool to create the file
   - Verify the description renders correctly in the PR after applying

   **Example Generated Description:**
   ```markdown
   ## Summary

   Adds URL scheme validation to version_fetcher.py to prevent path traversal attacks.

   ## Changes

   - Add `_validate_https_url()` helper function for URL scheme validation
   - Apply validation before all `urllib.request.urlopen()` calls
   - Add security annotations (`# nosec B310`) after validation

   ## Test Plan

   - [x] Bandit security scan passes
   - [x] Validation rejects file:// and http:// schemes
   - [x] HTTPS URLs are accepted
   - [x] All pre-commit hooks pass

   ```

### 1.3 Fetch Review Context

```bash
# Get unresolved review threads (GraphQL)
gh api graphql -f query='...'
# Get general issue comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments
```

### 1.4 Analyze with Superpowers

```bash
Skill(superpowers:receiving-code-review)
```
- Analyzes code context for each comment
- Suggests specific fixes
- Classifies feedback by impact and scope

**Step 1 Output**: PR metadata, all review comments, initial analysis

---

## Step 2: Triage (Classification)

**Purpose**: Classify comments by type and priority to determine what to fix now vs. later.

**Skip when**: Single simple fix with obvious resolution.

### 2.1 Check Existing Backlog Context (Optional but Recommended)

   Before classifying comments, check if relevant backlog documentation exists:
   ```bash
   # Check for existing backlog files that may provide context
   ls docs/backlog/*.md 2>/dev/null
   # Key files to check:
   # - docs/backlog/queue.md - Active backlog items with worthiness scores
   # - docs/backlog/technical-debt.md - Known technical debt items
   ```

If these files exist:
- Cross-reference out-of-scope items against existing backlog entries
- Avoid creating duplicate GitHub issues for items already tracked
- Link new issues to related existing items when appropriate

### 2.2 Classify Comments

| Type | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Bugs, security issues | Fix immediately |
| **In-Scope** | Requirements-related | Address in this PR |
| **Suggestion** | Improvements | **Create GitHub issue (Step 6)** |
| **Deferred** | Medium priority, future work, out-of-scope | **Create GitHub issue (Step 6)** |
| **Informational** | Questions, praise | Reply only |

> **Note**: If you classify ANY item as "deferred", "out-of-scope", "suggestion", or "future work", Step 6 will create GitHub issues for them.

**Step 2 Output**: Classified comment list with types and priorities

---

## Step 3: Plan (Fix Strategy)

**Purpose**: Generate fix strategies for each actionable comment.

**Skip when**: Fixes are obvious and don't require planning.

### 3.1 Generate Fix Strategies

For each actionable comment, superpowers analyzes:
- Code context around comment location
- Best practices for the suggested change
- Impact on related code
- Test implications

### 3.2 Determine Commit Strategy

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Single** | Simple fixes, few comments |
| **Separate** | Complex fixes, multiple categories |
| **Manual** | User wants control over commits |

**Step 3 Output**: Fix plan with strategies per comment

---

## Step 4: Fix (Apply Changes)

**Purpose**: Apply code changes systematically.

**Skip when**: Just need validation (already made changes manually).

### 4.1 Apply Fixes Systematically

```bash
# For each approved fix:
1. Read code context (±20 lines)
2. Apply fix with Edit tool
3. Verify no new issues introduced
4. Mark as completed
```

### 4.2 Commit Changes

- **Single**: "Address PR review feedback"
- **Separate**: One commit per fix category
- **Manual**: Stage changes, user commits

**Step 4 Output**: Applied fixes, commits created

---

## Step 5: Validate (Test & Verify)

**Purpose**: Ensure all fixes are correct and quality gates pass.

**Skip when**: Already validated manually.

### 5.1 Version Validation (MANDATORY IF APPLICABLE)

**CRITICAL: If `/pr-review` flagged any version issues (B-VERSION), you MUST verify they were fixed.**

Before proceeding to test plan execution, re-run version validation to confirm all version files are now consistent.

**Check for Version Issues in Review:**
```bash
# Check if version validation issues were flagged in the review
# Look for B-VERSION tags in review comments or test plan
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("B-VERSION")) | .body'
```

**Re-run Version Validation (if version issues existed):**
    ```bash
    # Detect project type
    PROJECT_TYPE=""
    if [[ -f ".claude-plugin/marketplace.json" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="claude-marketplace"
    elif [[ -f "pyproject.toml" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="python"
    elif [[ -f "package.json" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="node"
    elif [[ -f "Cargo.toml" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="rust"
    fi

    # Re-validate based on project type
    case $PROJECT_TYPE in
      claude-marketplace)
        # Verify marketplace.json matches all plugin.json files
        ECOSYSTEM_VERSION=$(jq -r '.metadata.version' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
        echo "Ecosystem version: $ECOSYSTEM_VERSION"

        MISMATCHES=0
        jq -r '.plugins[] | "\(.name):\(.version)"' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | while IFS=: read -r name version; do
          if [[ -f "plugins/$name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" ]]; then
            ACTUAL=$(jq -r '.version' "plugins/$name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json")
            if [[ "$version" != "$ACTUAL" ]]; then
              echo "❌ STILL MISMATCHED: $name (marketplace=$version, actual=$ACTUAL)"
              MISMATCHES=$((MISMATCHES + 1))
            else
              echo "✓ $name: $version"
            fi
          fi
        done

        # Check CHANGELOG entry exists
        if [[ -f "CHANGELOG.md" ]] && ! grep -q "\[$ECOSYSTEM_VERSION\]" CHANGELOG.md; then
          echo "❌ CHANGELOG.md still missing entry for $ECOSYSTEM_VERSION"
          MISMATCHES=$((MISMATCHES + 1))
        fi
        ;;

      python)
        # Verify pyproject.toml matches __version__ in code
        TOML_VERSION=$(grep "^version" pyproject.toml | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
        if [[ -d "src" ]]; then
          VERSION_PY=$(find src -name "__init__.py" -exec grep -l "__version__" {} \; | head -1)
          if [[ -n "$VERSION_PY" ]]; then
            CODE_VERSION=$(grep "__version__" "$VERSION_PY" | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
            if [[ "$TOML_VERSION" != "$CODE_VERSION" ]]; then
              echo "❌ STILL MISMATCHED: pyproject.toml=$TOML_VERSION, $VERSION_PY=$CODE_VERSION"
            else
              echo "✓ Python versions consistent: $TOML_VERSION"
            fi
          fi
        fi
        ;;

      node)
        # Verify package.json matches package-lock.json
        PKG_VERSION=$(jq -r '.version' package.json)
        if [[ -f "package-lock.json" ]]; then
          LOCK_VERSION=$(jq -r '.version' package-lock.json)
          if [[ "$PKG_VERSION" != "$LOCK_VERSION" ]]; then
            echo "❌ STILL MISMATCHED: package.json=$PKG_VERSION, package-lock.json=$LOCK_VERSION"
          else
            echo "✓ Node versions consistent: $PKG_VERSION"
          fi
        fi
        ;;

      rust)
        # Verify Cargo.toml version
        CARGO_VERSION=$(grep "^version" Cargo.toml | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
        echo "✓ Cargo.toml version: $CARGO_VERSION"
        # Check Cargo.lock is updated (regenerated)
        if [[ -f "Cargo.lock" ]]; then
          echo "ℹ️ Verify Cargo.lock was regenerated after version update"
        fi
        ;;
    esac
    ```

**Version Validation Must Pass**

**If any version mismatches remain, DO NOT proceed. Fix them first.**

| Version Issue Type | Fix Required |
|-------------------|--------------|
| marketplace.json vs plugin.json mismatch | Update marketplace.json OR plugin.json to match |
| pyproject.toml vs __version__ mismatch | Sync both to same version |
| package.json vs package-lock.json mismatch | Run `npm install` to regenerate lock |
| Missing CHANGELOG entry | Add entry for new version |

### 5.2 Execute Test Plan

After applying fixes and version validation, execute the test plan generated by `/pr-review`.

**Locate Test Plan:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Check if test plan was saved to file
   ls .pr-review/test-plan-*.md 2>/dev/null

   # Option 2: Search PR comments for test plan (generated by /pr-review)
   # Look for comments with "## Test Plan for PR #"
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments \
     --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("## Test Plan for PR")) | {id: .id, created_at: .created_at, body: .body}'
   ```

   **Test Plan Discovery Rules:**
   - Check for local file first (`.pr-review/test-plan-*.md`)
   - If not found, search PR comments for "## Test Plan for PR #N"
   - The test plan comment contains:
     - Prerequisites checklist
     - Verification steps for each issue (numbered: B1, B2, S1, S2, etc.)
     - Quality gate commands
     - Summary checklist table
   - Parse the test plan and create TodoWrite items for each verification step

### 5.3 Execute Verification Steps

For each issue in the test plan, run the verification steps:

    ```markdown
    ### Test Plan Execution

    #### B1: Missing token validation
    - [x] Review the fix at `middleware/auth.py:45`
    - [x] Run: `pytest tests/test_auth.py -k "token_validation" -v` → PASSED
    - [x] Manual check: Invalid token returns 401 [DONE]
    - [x] Error response verified [DONE]

    #### B2: SQL injection vulnerability
    - [x] Review the fix at `models/user.py:123`
    - [x] Run: `bandit -r models/ -ll` → No high-severity issues
    - [x] Run: `pytest tests/test_models.py -k "sql" -v` → PASSED
    - [x] Parameterized queries verified [DONE]
    ```

### 5.4 Run Quality Gates

```bash
# Execute the quality gate commands from the test plan
make test && make lint && make build

# Or project-specific commands
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run ruff check .
```

### 5.5 Document Test Results

Record test execution results for the summary:

    ```markdown
    ### Test Plan Results

    | Issue ID | Verification | Status | Notes |
    |----------|--------------|--------|-------|
    | B1 | All steps passed | PASS | Token validation working |
    | B2 | All steps passed | PASS | Parameterized queries |
    | S1 | All steps passed | PASS | Password reset implemented |

    **Quality Gates:**
    - Tests: 142 passed, 0 failed [PASS]
    - Lint: No issues [PASS]
    - Build: Success [PASS]
    ```

**Test Plan Execution Rules:**
- Execute ALL verification steps for blocking issues
- Execute ALL verification steps for in-scope issues
- Run quality gate commands AFTER individual issue verification
- Document any failures and fix before proceeding
- All tests must pass before moving to Phase 4

**If Test Plan Not Found:**
If no test plan exists from `/pr-review`, generate verification steps on-the-fly:
1. For each fix applied, identify relevant test file
2. Run targeted tests for the modified code
3. Run overall quality gates
4. Document results

**Step 5 Output**: All tests passing, quality gates green

---

## Step 6: Complete (Threads, Issues, Summary)

**Purpose**: Resolve threads, create issues for deferred items, and post summary.

**Skip when**: Just needed fixes without GitHub workflow completion.

### 6.1 Create Issues for Suggestions/Deferred Items

**CRITICAL: Create GitHub issues for ALL suggestion and deferred items.**

For each comment classified as **Suggestion** during triage, create a GitHub issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "[Suggestion] <description from review comment>" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Background

   Identified during PR #PR_NUMBER review as a suggestion for improvement.

   **Original Review Comment:**
   > [Quote the review comment here]

   **Location:** `file/path.py:line` (if applicable)

   ## Suggested Improvement

   [Describe the suggested improvement based on the review feedback]

   ## Value

   [Explain why this improvement would be valuable - performance, UX, maintainability, etc.]

   ## Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] [Specific criteria based on the suggestion]
   - [ ] Tests added/updated (if applicable)
   - [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

   ## References

   - PR #PR_NUMBER: [PR URL]
   - Original review comment: [Link if available]

   ---
   *Created from PR #PR_NUMBER review triage*
   EOF
   )" \
     --label "suggestion" \
     --label "enhancement"
   ```

   **Suggestion Issue Rules:**
   - Prefix title with "[Suggestion]" for easy identification
   - Always use the "suggestion" label (required for tracking)
   - Add additional labels as appropriate (enhancement, documentation, testing, etc.)
   - Include the original review comment verbatim
   - Explain the value/improvement rationale
   - Reference the source PR
   - Define clear acceptance criteria

**Track Created Suggestion Issues:**
After creating issues, document them in the PR comment:
```markdown
### Suggestions → GitHub Issues

| Review Item | Issue Created | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| S1 | #43 | Clarify ruff-format comment |
| S2 | #44 | Improve test output verbosity |
```

### 6.2 Create Issues for Deferred/Out-of-Scope Items

For each comment classified as **Deferred** (including "out-of-scope", "medium priority", "future work") during triage, create a GitHub issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "<type>(<scope>): <description from review comment>" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Background

   Identified during PR #PR_NUMBER review as out-of-scope.

   **Original Review Comment:**
   > [Quote the review comment here]

   **Location:** `file/path.py:line` (if applicable)

   ## Scope

   [Describe what needs to be done based on the review feedback]

   ## Suggested Implementation

   [Any suggestions from the review or analysis]

   ## Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] [Specific criteria based on the feedback]
   - [ ] Tests added/updated
   - [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

   ## References

   - PR #PR_NUMBER: [PR URL]
   - Original review comment: [Link if available]

   ---
   *Created from PR #PR_NUMBER review triage*
   EOF
   )" \
     --label "enhancement"
   ```

**Issue Creation Rules:**
- Use conventional commit format for title: `type(scope): description`
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `perf`, `refactor`
- Include the original review comment in the body
- Add relevant labels (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)
- Reference the source PR
- Define clear acceptance criteria

### 6.3 Thread Resolution (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: You MUST reply to and resolve each review thread after fixing. This is not optional.**

> **Important:** Thread IDs (format: `PRRT_*`) are different from comment IDs. You need thread IDs for both replies and resolution.

**Get All Review Threads:**
   ```bash
   # Fetch all review threads with their IDs and resolution status
   # Note: Use literal owner/repo/pr values - do NOT use $() substitution inside gh commands
   gh api graphql -f query='
   query {
     repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
       pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
         reviewThreads(first: 100) {
           nodes {
             id
             isResolved
             path
             line
             comments(first: 1) {
               nodes {
                 body
                 author { login }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

Replace `OWNER`, `REPO`, and `PR_NUMBER` with actual values. The thread `id` field returns the `PRRT_*` ID needed for replies and resolution.

**Reply to Each Thread with Fix Description:**
   For EACH review comment that was addressed, use the GraphQL mutation (NOT REST API):
   ```bash
   # Reply using addPullRequestReviewThreadReply mutation
   # The pullRequestReviewThreadId is the PRRT_* ID from step 19
   gh api graphql -f query='
   mutation {
     addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
       pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_kwDOxxxxxx"
       body: "Fixed - added input validation for slug parameter. Rejects injection characters."
     }) {
       comment { id }
     }
   }'
   ```

   **Reply format requirements:**
   - Use "Fixed" prefix for fixed items
   - Briefly describe what was changed
   - Reference the file/line if helpful
   - Keep it concise (1-2 sentences)

   **Common mistakes to avoid:**
   - Do NOT use `addPullRequestReviewComment` - it lacks thread support
   - Do NOT use REST API `/comments/{id}/replies` - it doesn't work for review threads
   - Use `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` with the `PRRT_*` thread ID

**Resolve the Thread:**
After replying, resolve the thread:
    ```bash
    # Resolve the review thread via GraphQL mutation
    gh api graphql -f query='
    mutation {
      resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_kwDOxxxxxx"}) {
        thread { isResolved }
      }
    }'
    ```

    **Batch resolution pattern:**
    ```bash
    # Resolve multiple threads in a loop
    for thread_id in PRRT_abc123 PRRT_def456 PRRT_ghi789; do
      gh api graphql -f query="
    mutation {
      resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"$thread_id\"}) {
        thread { isResolved }
      }
    }"
    done
    ```

**Verify All Threads Resolved:**
    ```bash
    # Count unresolved threads - should return 0
    gh api graphql -f query='
    query {
      repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
        pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
          reviewThreads(first: 100) {
            nodes {
              isResolved
              path
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }' --jq '[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)] | length'
    ```

### 6.4 Issue Linkage & Closure

**Analyze whether this PR addresses any open issues and close/comment on them accordingly.**

**Fetch Open Issues:**
```bash
# Get all open issues for the repository
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels --limit 50
```

**Analyze Issue Coverage:**

    For each open issue, analyze whether the PR's changes address it:

    ```bash
    # Get PR changed files and commit messages
    gh pr view --json files,commits -q '{files: .files[].path, commits: .commits[].messageHeadline}'

    # Compare against issue requirements:
    # - Extract acceptance criteria from issue body
    # - Check if changed files relate to issue scope
    # - Review commit messages for issue references
    ```

    **Classification:**
    | Status | Criteria | Action |
    |--------|----------|--------|
    | **Fully Addressed** | All acceptance criteria met, all required changes made | Comment + Close |
    | **Partially Addressed** | Some criteria met, some work remaining | Comment with follow-up details |
    | **Not Related** | PR doesn't touch issue scope | Skip |

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Smart Fix Generation

uses superpowers to understand context:

```javascript
// Comment: "Add error handling for null values"
// Superpowers analyzes:
// - Current function signature
// - Error handling patterns in codebase
// - Testing requirements
// - Performance implications

// Generated fix:
function processData(data) {
  if (!data) {
    throw new Error('Data cannot be null or undefined');
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### 2. Batch Fix Operations

Groups related fixes for efficiency:

```bash
# Detects patterns:
- 5 comments about missing tests
- 3 comments about error handling
- 2 comments about documentation

# Applies fixes by batch:
1. Add all missing tests
2. Implement error handling
3. Update documentation
```

### 3. Backlog Triage

Creates GitHub issues for out-of-scope items:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[Enhancement] Add caching layer" \
  --body="Identified during PR #123 review
  Consider implementing Redis caching for API responses
  Priority: Medium
  Estimated effort: 2-3 days" \
  --label="enhancement,backlog"
```

## Example Execution

```bash
# Run with default settings
/fix-pr

# Dry run to see planned changes
/fix-pr --dry-run

# Specific PR with separate commits
/fix-pr 42 --commit-strategy separate
```

### Sample Output

```markdown
PR #42: Found 12 review comments

### Triage Results

## Error Handling

### Permission Issues
```bash
Warning: Cannot resolve threads (permission denied)
Fixes applied locally. Please resolve threads manually.
```

### Thread Resolution Failures
```bash
# If thread reply fails
Error: Failed to reply to thread {thread_id}
Fallback: Post a general PR comment referencing the fix

# If thread resolution fails
Error: Failed to resolve thread {thread_id}
Action: Document the thread ID for manual resolution
```

### Missing Thread IDs
```bash
# If GraphQL returns empty thread list
Warning: No review threads found via GraphQL
Fallback: Use REST API to fetch review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
```

### Complex Fixes
```bash
Error: Fix for comment #5 requires architectural decision
Manual intervention needed:
"Consider whether we should use factory pattern here"
```

### Conflicts
```bash
Warning: Fixes for comments 3 and 4 conflict
Comment 3: "Make function async"
Comment 4: "Remove async from function"
Manual resolution required.
```

## Best Practices

### Before Running
1. validate clean working directory
2. Pull latest changes from remote
3. Confirm PR is still open
4. Check for merge conflicts

### During Execution
1. Review proposed fixes before applying
2. Monitor for unexpected side effects
3. Keep detailed logs of changes made
4. Verify tests still pass after each batch

### After Completion
1. Push changes to remote
2. **VERIFY all threads have replies** - each addressed comment must have a response
3. **Threads auto-resolved via Phase 7** - `/resolve-threads` runs automatically
4. **POST SUMMARY COMMENT (MANDATORY)** - See Phase 6. This step is NOT optional.
5. Check CI pipeline status
6. Notify reviewers of updates
7. If any threads couldn't be resolved, document them in a PR comment

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub API Limits
```bash
Error: GitHub API rate limit exceeded
Solution: Wait and retry, or use --dry-run mode
```

### Complex Review Comments
```bash
Warning: Unable to auto-generate fix for comment
Manual review required: "Consider broader architectural implications"
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
Error: Fix conflicts with recent changes
Solution: Pull latest, resolve conflicts, re-run the command
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Bash Command Substitution in gh Commands

**Problem:** Using `$()` substitution inside `gh api` commands causes shell syntax errors.

```bash
# WRONG - This FAILS with syntax errors
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/40/comments  # Breaks due to escaping issues
```

**Solution:** Get repo info separately, then use literal values:

```bash
# CORRECT - get info first, then use literals
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
# Returns: owner/repo

# Then use the actual values directly in the query
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/40/comments
```

### Wrong Mutation for Thread Replies

**Problem:** `addPullRequestReviewComment` mutation doesn't accept `pullRequestReviewThreadId`.

```bash
# WRONG - This FAILS
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewComment(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_xxx"  # Not a valid field!
    body: "Fixed"
  }) { comment { id } }
}'
```

**Solution:** Use `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` instead:

```bash
# CORRECT - This works
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_xxx"
    body: "Fixed"
  }) { comment { id } }
}'
```

### REST API for Review Thread Replies

**Problem:** REST API endpoint for comment replies doesn't work for review threads.

**Solution:** Always use GraphQL `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` for review threads.

### Thread ID vs Comment ID Confusion

**Problem:** Review comments have both comment IDs (numeric) and thread IDs (`PRRT_*`). Resolution requires thread IDs.

**Solution:** When fetching review threads, extract the `id` field which contains the `PRRT_*` thread ID:

```bash
# The 'id' field in reviewThreads.nodes is the PRRT_* thread ID
gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[].id'
# Returns: PRRT_kwDOQcL40c5l9_nO
```

## Migration Notes

- `/fix-pr` now includes the enhanced superpowers-driven workflow (formerly `/fix-pr-wrapper`).
- Use `--dry-run` to preview the planned fixes before applying changes.

## Notes

- Requires GitHub CLI authentication
- Works best with superpowers code review analysis
- Maintains full backward compatibility
- Preserves all original Sanctum GitHub integrations
- Adds intelligent fix generation and contextual understanding
- **Thread resolution is MANDATORY** - every addressed comment MUST receive a reply and be resolved
- If thread resolution fails, document the failure and attempt manual resolution
- **Issue linkage** automatically analyzes open issues and closes/comments on addressed ones
- Use `--skip-issue-linkage` for faster execution when issue analysis is not needed
- **Threads auto-resolved** - `/resolve-threads` runs automatically as Phase 7 for final cleanup
- **Version validation verification** (Phase 3.5) re-checks version consistency after fixes are applied
  - Ensures B-VERSION issues from `/pr-review` were actually fixed
  - Blocks proceeding to test plan execution if version mismatches remain
  - Supports: pyproject.toml, package.json, Cargo.toml, marketplace.json, CHANGELOG.md

## Integration with Attune Workflow

This command follows the attune-style progressive workflow pattern:

```
Attune Workflow        | /fix-pr Equivalent
-----------------------|-------------------
/attune:brainstorm     | (PR review received)
/attune:arch-init      | --
/attune:specify        | Step 1: Analyze
/attune:plan           | Step 2-3: Triage + Plan
/attune:init           | --
/attune:execute        | Step 4-5: Fix + Validate
/attune:validate       | (included in Step 5)
/attune:upgrade        | (optional: /attune:upgrade --component workflows)
```

## See Also

- `/fix-issue` - Fix GitHub issues using same progressive workflow
- `/resolve-threads` - Batch-resolve review threads (runs automatically in Step 6)
- `/pr-review` - Review a PR and post findings as GitHub comments (generates test plan)
