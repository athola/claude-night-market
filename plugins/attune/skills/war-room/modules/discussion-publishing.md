# Discussion Publishing

Publish completed war room deliberations to GitHub Discussions for cross-session discovery.

## When This Module Applies

This module activates **after Phase 7 (Supreme Commander Synthesis)** completes. It is an additional publication channel — the local strategeion archive continues as the primary record.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub platform detected (check `git_platform` session context)
- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status` succeeds)
- Repository has Discussions enabled with a "Decisions" category
- Leyline command-mapping Discussion templates available

## Publishing Flow

### Step 1: Prompt for User Approval (MANDATORY)

After the Supreme Commander Decision document is finalized, ask:

```
Publish this decision to GitHub Discussions? [Y/n]
```

If the user declines ("n"), skip all subsequent steps. The local strategeion workflow continues unchanged.

### Step 2: Resolve Repository and Category IDs

```bash
# Get repository node ID
REPO_INFO=$(gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    id
    hasDiscussionsEnabled
    discussionCategories(first: 25) {
      nodes { id name slug }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="OWNER" -f repo="REPO")
```

Extract `repositoryId` and find the category nodeID where `slug` equals `"decisions"`.

If Discussions are not enabled or the "Decisions" category doesn't exist, warn the user and skip publishing:
```
⚠ Discussions not available (feature disabled or "Decisions" category missing). Skipping publication.
```

### Step 3: Create the Discussion

Create a Discussion in the "Decisions" category:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($repoId: ID!, $categoryId: ID!, $title: String!, $body: String!) {
  createDiscussion(input: {
    repositoryId: $repoId,
    categoryId: $categoryId,
    title: $title,
    body: $body
  }) {
    discussion { number id url }
  }
}' -f repoId="$REPO_ID" -f categoryId="$CATEGORY_ID" \
   -f title="[War Room] $TOPIC" \
   -f body="$BODY"
```

**Title format**: `[War Room] <topic from session invocation>`

**Body structure**:
```markdown
## Context

<Context from the Supreme Commander Decision document>

## Decision

**Selected Approach**: <selected approach name>

<Decision rationale>

## Consequences

<Positive, negative, and neutral consequences>

## Reversibility Assessment

| Supreme Commander | ... | ... |
| Chief Strategist | ... | ... |
| Red Team | ... | ... |

---
*Session: <session_id> | Strategeion: `<local_file_path>`*
```

### Step 4: Post Deliberation Phases as Comments

Post each major phase as a threaded comment on the Discussion. This preserves the deliberation trail without overwhelming the Discussion body.

**Comments to post** (in order):
1. **Intelligence Report** — key findings from Phase 1
2. **Situation Assessment** — Phase 2 analysis summary
3. **COA Summary** — brief of each Course of Action (Phase 3)
4. **Red Team Challenges** — key challenges and responses (Phase 4)
5. **Supreme Commander Synthesis** — the final decision rationale (Phase 7)

For each comment:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($discussionId: ID!, $body: String!) {
  addDiscussionComment(input: {
    discussionId: $discussionId,
    body: $body
  }) {
    comment { id url }
  }
}' -f discussionId="$DISCUSSION_ID" -f body="### Phase N: <Phase Name>

<Phase summary — keep under 500 words per comment>

*Full details in strategeion: \`<local_file_path>\`*"
```

### Step 5: Mark Synthesis as Answer

Mark the final Supreme Commander Synthesis comment as the Discussion answer:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($commentId: ID!) {
  markDiscussionCommentAsAnswer(input: {
    id: $commentId
  }) {
    discussion { id answerChosenAt }
  }
}' -f commentId="$SYNTHESIS_COMMENT_ID"
```

Note: `markDiscussionCommentAsAnswer` only works if the Discussion category supports answers. The "Decisions" category uses Announcement format which does not support answers. If the mutation fails, log a warning and continue — the synthesis is still the last comment.

### Step 6: Apply Labels

Apply labels to the Discussion for discoverability. Labels must already exist on the repository.

Recommended labels:
- `war-room` — always applied
- `type-1a`, `type-1b`, or `type-2` — matching the decision type from RS assessment
- Topic-relevant labels (e.g., `architecture`, `performance`, `security`)

Label application requires a separate mutation:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($labelableId: ID!, $labelIds: [ID!]!) {
  addLabelsToLabelable(input: {
    labelableId: $labelableId,
    labelIds: $labelIds
  }) {
    labelable { ... on Discussion { id } }
  }
}'
```

If label application fails (labels don't exist), log a warning and continue.

### Step 7: Update Local Strategeion

Add the Discussion URL to the local strategeion session file:

```yaml
discussion_url: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/discussions/NUMBER
discussion_number: NUMBER
published_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```

This cross-reference allows future sessions to navigate from local artifact to the published Discussion and vice versa.

## Error Handling

- **Network failure during publishing**: Log warning, preserve local artifacts. Do not retry automatically — the user can re-publish manually.
- **Rate limiting**: If GitHub returns 429, warn the user and skip. Do not block the session.
- **Missing category**: Warn and skip. Do not auto-create categories.
- **`gh` not authenticated**: Skip with message: "GitHub CLI not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` to enable Discussion publishing."

## Token Conservation

- Discussion body: max 2000 words (NFR-005)
- Phase comments: max 500 words each
- Link to strategeion files for full details rather than duplicating content
- Total published content should be a readable summary, not a transcript

## Prior Decision Check

Before starting a new war room session, search for prior decisions on the same topic. See the "Prior Decision Check" section below.

---

## Prior Decision Check

When a war room session starts (before Phase 1), search existing Discussions for prior decisions in the same area.

### Search Flow

1. Extract topic keywords from the war room invocation argument
2. Search Discussions:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($searchQuery: String!) {
  search(query: $searchQuery, type: DISCUSSION, first: 5) {
    discussionCount
    nodes {
      ... on Discussion {
        number
        title
        url
        createdAt
        body
        answer { body }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f searchQuery="repo:OWNER/REPO category:Decisions TOPIC_KEYWORDS"
```

3. If matches found, present to user:

```
Found prior decisions on this topic:
  #42 [War Room] Database migration strategy (2026-02-15)
  #38 [War Room] API versioning approach (2026-02-10)

Review before proceeding? [Y/n/skip]
```

### User Responses

- **Y (review)**: Display the prior decision summary. Then ask:
  - "Does this prior decision still apply? [Y/n]"
    - **Y**: Skip war room. Record a note: "Reaffirmed Decision #42. No new deliberation needed."
    - **N**: Proceed with war room. New Discussion will reference the prior: `Supersedes: #42`
- **n (proceed)**: Start war room without reviewing prior decisions
- **skip**: Disable prior decision check for this session

### No Matches

If no matching Discussions are found, proceed directly to Phase 1 without delay.
