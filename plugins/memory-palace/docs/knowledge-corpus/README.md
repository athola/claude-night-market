# Knowledge Corpus

External resources stored in memory palace format to inform plugin development and skill design.

## Purpose

This corpus captures valuable insights from articles, blog posts, research papers, and other external sources. By storing them in memory palace format, we:

1. **Preserve context** - Maintain structured notes on important concepts
2. **Enable cross-reference** - Link external insights to internal skills
3. **Build patterns** - Identify recurring themes across sources
4. **Inform development** - Apply learned patterns to plugin improvements

## Structure

Each entry follows the memory palace schema:
- **Palace**: Thematic grouping (e.g., "Learning Techniques", "AI Patterns")
- **Location**: Specific source or concept cluster
- **Concept**: Key insight with sensory encoding
- **Associations**: Links to related concepts and skills

## Adding New Entries

When adding external resources:
1. Extract key concepts using the "Franklin Protocol"
2. Create structured notes with explicit associations
3. Link to relevant internal skills and patterns
4. Tag with maturity level (seedling → evergreen)
