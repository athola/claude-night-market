# KonMari Method: The Philosophy of Tidying

Marie Kondo's approach to decluttering, adapted for knowledge governance in the memory palace.

## Core Thesis

> "The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life."

Tidying is not about discarding—it's about choosing what to keep. The criterion is not utility or time, but **joy and alignment with your ideal life**.

## Memory Palace Layout

```
KonMari Philosophy Palace
├── Commitment Hall (Rule 1)
│   └── Full commitment required - no half-measures
├── Vision Chamber (Rule 2)
│   └── Imagine your ideal lifestyle BEFORE tidying
├── Release Gate (Rule 3)
│   └── Finish discarding before organizing
├── Category Library (Rule 4)
│   └── Tidy by category, not location
├── Order Path (Rule 5)
│   └── Clothes → Books → Papers → Komono → Sentimental
└── Joy Sanctuary (Rule 6)
    └── Does it spark joy? The only question that matters
```

## The Six Rules

### 1. Commit Yourself to Tidying
Don't half-tidy. Partial cleanup leaves worse mess than none. When you begin, complete the process.

### 2. Imagine Your Ideal Lifestyle
Before touching anything, envision the life you want to live. Your aspirations define what belongs.

### 3. Finish Discarding First
Don't reorganize before releasing. Moving clutter to new locations is not tidying—it's hiding.

### 4. Tidy by Category, Not Location
Gather ALL items of one category together. This reveals true scope and redundancy.

### 5. Follow the Right Order
From easiest to hardest emotional attachment:
1. Clothes (References in knowledge terms)
2. Books (Techniques)
3. Papers (Insights)
4. Komono/Miscellaneous (Frameworks)
5. Sentimental items (Aspirational/Identity)

Build decision-making muscle before confronting core beliefs.

### 6. Ask: Does It Spark Joy?

The physical test:
- Pick up each item
- Hold it in your hands
- Feel your response

> "A little thrill, as if the cells in your body are slowly rising."

This is joy. Obligation, guilt, and "should" are not joy.

## The Joy Test Adapted for Knowledge

| Response | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Enthusiasm, curiosity, energy | Sparks joy | Keep |
| Obligation, guilt, "should" | Does not spark joy | Release |
| "I might need this someday" | Fear, not joy | Release |
| Neutral, no response | Test with aspirational lens | Revisit |

## Releasing with Gratitude

When something no longer serves you:
1. **Acknowledge** its contribution to your growth
2. **Thank it** for its role in your development
3. **Release it** consciously

This is cognitive closure. Unprocessed releases create mental residue.

## Key Insight for Knowledge Governance

Traditional pruning: "Delete if not accessed in 90 days"
KonMari pruning: "Does this spark joy AND serve who you are becoming?"

**Time is not the criterion. Alignment is.**

## The Master Curator

Only the human can answer:
- What domains am I growing into?
- What have I consciously left behind?
- What represents my past self, not my future self?

Claude can prompt these questions. Claude cannot answer them for you.

## Warning Signs: Suggest Tidying

A polluted knowledge base (like a cluttered home) causes harm:
- Mental noise from contradictory patterns
- Decision paralysis from too many options
- False confidence from stale information
- Identity confusion from keeping what you've outgrown

**When Claude notices these signs: SUGGEST tidying, never act autonomously.**

## The Curator Approval Requirement

> **CRITICAL: All tidying actions require explicit human approval.**

Claude's role:
- **CAN**: Detect, suggest, prompt, prepare options
- **CANNOT**: Archive, delete, deprecate, or modify without explicit approval

```
Claude DETECTS → Claude SUGGESTS → Curator DECIDES → Claude EXECUTES (only if approved)
```

**Your palace. Your rules. Your approval required.**
