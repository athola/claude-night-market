# Sensory Encoding for Memory Palaces

Multi-sensory encoding creates stronger memory traces by engaging multiple cognitive pathways.

## Sensory Channels

### Visual
- **Colors** - Associate concepts with distinctive colors
- **Shapes** - Use geometric forms for categories
- **Lighting** - Bright for important, dim for peripheral
- **Motion** - Animate key concepts for emphasis

### Auditory
- **Ambient sounds** - Background noise for context (library quiet, workshop clanking)
- **Voice associations** - Mental narration or character voices
- **Music** - Melodies linked to concept groups
- **Alerts** - Distinctive sounds for warnings or importance

### Spatial
- **Size** - Larger for more important concepts
- **Position** - Eye level for frequently accessed, corners for rare
- **Distance** - Grouped by relationship proximity
- **Orientation** - Facing direction indicates flow

### Tactile
- **Textures** - Smooth for familiar, rough for challenging
- **Temperature** - Warm for welcoming, cool for technical
- **Weight** - Heavy for foundational, light for derived

## Encoding Strategy

### For Each Location:
1. **Primary sense** - The dominant sensory experience
2. **Secondary sense** - Supporting sensory detail
3. **Trigger** - The specific cue that activates recall

### Example Encoding:
```yaml
location: "API Documentation Room"
primary:
  sense: visual
  detail: "Walls covered in flowing blue diagrams"
secondary:
  sense: auditory
  detail: "Soft humming of data flow"
trigger: "Blue glow when entering"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Make it vivid** - Exaggerate sensory details for memorability
2. **Use personal anchors** - Connect to your own experiences
3. **Maintain consistency** - Same colors/sounds for same concept types
4. **Create contrast** - Different areas should feel distinct
5. **Test recall** - Verify triggers actually work for you
