# Memory Palace Validation

Systematic validation ensures your memory palace actually works for recall and navigation.

## Validation Metrics

### Recall Speed
- **Target**: Retrieve concept location in < 5 seconds
- **Method**: Random concept quiz, measure time to locate
- **Acceptable**: 80% of concepts under target time

### Navigation Efficiency
- **Target**: Reach any concept in ≤ 3 mental steps
- **Method**: Trace path from entry to random concept
- **Acceptable**: Average path length ≤ 3.5 steps

### Association Strength
- **Target**: Sensory details recalled with concept
- **Method**: Name concept, describe its encoding
- **Acceptable**: 70% recall of primary sensory details

### Scalability
- **Target**: Palace handles 2x current concepts
- **Method**: Mentally add new concepts, check for congestion
- **Acceptable**: Clear placement for hypothetical additions

## Testing Protocol

### Initial Validation (After Creation)
1. Walk through entire palace mentally
2. Name each room and its purpose
3. Identify any confusing areas
4. Note navigation dead-ends

### Recall Testing (Weekly)
1. Select 10 random concepts
2. For each: locate in palace, describe encoding
3. Record time and accuracy
4. Identify weak spots for reinforcement

### Stress Testing (Monthly)
1. Rapid-fire concept location (30 in 2 minutes)
2. Cross-reference navigation (A→B→C paths)
3. Edge case access (rarely used areas)
4. New concept placement drill

## Improvement Actions

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Slow recall | >5s to locate | Strengthen sensory encoding |
| Confusion | Wrong location accessed | Add distinctive landmarks |
| Dead ends | No path to concept | Add navigation connections |
| Crowding | Too many concepts per room | Split room or create sublevel |
| Forgetting | Can't recall encoding | Refresh with more vivid imagery |

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All concepts have assigned locations
- [ ] Each location has distinctive encoding
- [ ] Navigation paths connect all areas
- [ ] Entry points are clearly defined
- [ ] Growth space is available
- [ ] Recall testing passes thresholds
