        summary: "Use Python's TaskGroup to keep concurrent child tasks scoped to the lifetime of a request handler."
        playbook_steps:
          - "Create a TaskGroup per inbound request context."

          - "Propagate cancellations when the handler scope exits."

# NOTE: This is a stub file demonstrating the refactoring pattern.
# Full topic data should be migrated from seed_corpus.py:_topics() function.
# To complete the migration:
# 1. Convert the Python Topic/Variation structures to YAML format
# 2. Update seed_corpus.py to load from this file
# 3. Remove the _topics() function (saves ~830 lines)
